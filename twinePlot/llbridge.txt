Pan-pan. This is Viridian actual. Radio check. Over.
[[Uh... what?|uh_what]] | [[Who is this?|who_is_this]]

This is Viridian actual. You are receiving?
Radio check. Over.
[[What does that mean?|what_radio]] | [[What's a "Viridian actual"?|what_viridian]]



:: what_viridian
Viridian is the name of the ship.
And "actual" means you're speaking to the person who's actually in charge of the actual ship...
...as opposed to my RTO.
And yes, I just realized that if I had to explain all that other crap...
...then I obviously have to explain that "RTO" stands for "radio telephone operator." Over.

You're thinking of ELO.

Huh. That's... not as comforting as you probably think it is.

Pan-pan.
That's... possible assistance needed. State of urgency, not yet emergency.
Just a heads-up to all receiving parties.
Although it looks like you're the ONLY receiving party. Over.
[[So is this a mayday call?|mayday_call]] | [[Are you in trouble?|mayday_two]]


:: what_radio
Radio check? It's... I'm asking for an evaluation of my signal strength and readability.
You know, like, "loud and clear." Or, "weak and intermittent."
Or, "This isn't technically a radio, it's a quantum tunneling communicator." Over.
[[Oh. That last one, then.|last_one]] | [[Loud and clear, I guess.|loud_clear]]

<<set $lastone = true>>
Great. Then unless they shipped me a bad batch of atoms...

[[So, that's... twenty-five?|informal]] | [[That's good, I'm guessing?|thats_good]]

The military doesn't pay me to hand out hugs.
Although, think about how great it would be if they DID.
I've been concentrating on my upper body lately. Got some pretty sweet biceps happening here.
I'm probably like ninety-eighth percentile in hugging.
They oughtta put me in charge of my own regiment of Care Bears.
If we could weaponize adorability, I'd blow a rainbow hole through Jupiter. Over.

Nah. But it just seems so smug. Sitting there, all huge and bloated.

Yeah, see... that's the problem.
Our black box -- you know, the voyage data recorder?
The thing that's supposed to keep on working, even when the rest of the ship is a smoldering wreck?
Yeah, the black box has stopped working.
I know this because of a little flashing light on the instrument panel...

Not an official one, at any rate. And that's why I sent out this call.
Now, listen... this isn't protocol. Far from it.
But I sent out a call because "two-way transmit" seems to be the only mode that's functional...

There aren't exactly any Jiffy Lubes out here in the far reaches, you know?
And, I mean, I'm pretty handy with a wrench -- I can change my oil or fix a flat --
but dual ion engines are a little outside my wheelhouse.
Like, LIGHT YEARS outside.
So the odds of getting some quick repairs done on the Viridian's black box...

But here's enough to keep you interested:
A mining vessel called the White Star intercepted a distress beacon from right out here...

Some kid named Taylor, sole survivor of a crashed ship...

Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm gonna call this moon "Jeff."
From all readings and anecdotal reports, Jeff's atmosphere is hospitable.
So we're gonna land on Jeff and then walk around a little.
And if Jeff starts acting weird, we're gonna blow him up.

This sector is so lightly trafficked, no one's bothered to come up with clever names...

This delightful hunk of desert is labeled 31U00W.
Catchy, huh?

[[Uh... sure.|sure_sequel]] | [[Nobody says that.|nobody_sequel]]

Okay, yeah, you were in contact with this Taylor kid...

Their Captain, Shepherd, contacted the Ninth with this crazysauce story...

...and a horde of "aliens," which, I'll be honest, we all had a good laugh about.
[[Every bit of that is accurate.|accurate]] | [[Nothing to laugh about.|aliens]]

Nope. Sorry. I'm not buying it.

Despite your most fervent hopes, <i>E.T.</i> was not a documentary...

We plunked the ship down on the biggest piece of flat ground we could find.

Like there was some sort of massive seismic activity or plate shift.
(I don't know if moons even HAVE tectonic plates.)
It's crazy, though... it's like all the cracks radiate out...

Your own five senses, then your instruments, then the military intel...

And, again, I'm not trying to sound like a jerk...

[[Whatever. Suit yourself.|suit_yourself]] | [[You'll regret not listening.|regret_it]]

We're here because the Ninth is beholden to the drillers, now, aren't we?

I know "mineral rights" isn't a very swashbuckling reason for space skirmishes...

Woof. You just morphed from "the next guy" into "my dad."

All right. Let's go put some footprints in the sand.
The peak is due west-southwest of where we landed.
Looks like we'll have a pretty easy stroll there, sticking to the edges of this little canyon...

As always, Ghost is a few paces ahead... except...

Not totally sure.

Hey, that's a good joke.
You know any others?
I'm not getting back to the Viridian, or anywhere else, without some serious help.
Just looked down and saw bone sticking through my spacesuit.
Tibia? Fibula? One of 'em.
I'm clearly in shock, because I'm numb all over...

What the hell direction do we go?
[[Run for the peak!|run_peak]] | [[Run back to the ship!|run_ship]]

What do you mean, "hunker down?"
We're inside a canyon! There are rock walls to either side, coated in scree!
If we stop here, we're likely to be buried in a rockslide.
We've got to run!
[[Fine, then! Run!|run_quake]] | [[No, just stay there!|stay_canyon]]

Maybe I'm not describing this well.
We're at the vaguely flat bottom of a "V" right now...

And I'm not sure how gravity works where YOU are...

I haven't been scared of anything since I was a girl.
I was a daredevil on my bike. A risk-taker at school.
Even when my dad kicked me out... I wasn't afraid. I knew I could get by.
Joined up with the Ninth the first day they'd take me.
Never so much as sniffled during boot camp, while guys twice my size were sobbing.
I haven't been scared for so long...
...I almost didn't recognize it when it crept back up on me.
But that's what this is.
This is scared.
This is helpless, and confused, and alone...
...and scared.

I'm trying. I promise, I am.
Closed my eyes. Counted to ten.
But when I opened them again... the creatures were still there. Ten counts closer.

Balty! Ghost! Get to that peak! NOW!
I don't -- crap, my communicator's not even working anymore!
Doesn't matter. They got the idea from my hand signals. They're on the move.
Ghost is already way out ahead of us, as usual.
I better shut my mouth and beat feet to that peak, try and catch up to them.
[[delay 5m^Mel is running|arrive_peak]]

The Viridian can weather whatever this stupid moon throws at it.

So... ALIEN.
I guess that's why they call 'em that.
Little bioluminescent, like, LUMPS, just sort of propelling themselves along...
...with little tendrils or something that kind of unfurl and then pull their bodies.
It's... almost hypnotic. This strange, undulating motion of the mass of them...
...coming toward me like the tide rolling in.
It's... interesting, isn't it?
The longer I stare at them, the calmer I feel.

Up ahead... I see somebody!
It's... it's Balty!
Standing there, helmet under his arm, sweat pouring down his face.
He's pointing at... yeah... Ghost is most of the way to the peak already.
Way out in front of us. As usual.
Only, here's the problem.
There's a big ol' crack in the moon's surface between him and us.
He must've jumped it when it was smaller...
...'cause I can actually see it expanding with my own two eyes, right in front of us.
It cuts across the whole canyon. We'd have to completely double back to avoid it.
I think I can cover the jump, no problem, even with the IEVA suit's bulk.

All right, all right, hang on. Just give me a second to think.
Maybe they took a different route? I don't see how, but...

Maybe they got hit by falling rocks.
Dammit! I can scan for them from the Viridian...

The little alien wants to be inside my helmet with me.
How adorable is that?

They're so ugly, it almost comes back around and becomes cute again.

Okay. We're here, at the peak.
The tremors seem to have stopped. I mean, there's always the worry of aftershocks...

But at least we're exploring a weird mountain, based on a ridiculous report...

So. That's a plus.

So I'm taking off my helmet, with all its worthless mapping HUDs...
