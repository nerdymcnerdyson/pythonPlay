"'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the ship,
We were roused from our sleep by a loud radar blip?"

:: lucky_star
It really WAS.
I mean, I had to expend some elbow grease to get a distress beacon set up...
...but yeah, it was pure luck that their mining ship was passing through the sector.
Because -- after three days out on that godforsaken rock --
I don't know that I could've lasted another three MINUTES without their intervention.
But hey. It's Christmastime. The season of miracles, right?
[[So they say.|alien_talk]] | [[You were alone on that moon?|alone_moon]]


:: actual_aliens
These were... I know how crazy it sounds, but they were real, live, xenobiological organisms.
Creepy little... I don't know, I've taken to calling them "occupiers."
Weird green lifeforms that got inside people, or inside rats -- living or dead --
and just kinda wore them around. Piloted them.
Made their eyes glow green like something out of a Stephen King story.
Not <i>Stand By Me,</i> but, like, one of the ones where something has creepy green eyes.
[[Kiefer Sutherland has creepy green eyes.^He's in <i>Stand By Me,</i> and his eyes are kinda weird.|kiefer]] | [[Aliens. That's... scary.|scary_aliens]]
//Stand By Me is a film adaptation of a Stephen King story; Kiefer Sutherland is one of the stars.


:: unicorn_news
Not to mention butt rainbows.
...Huh.
That's interesting.
[[What's interesting?|shiny_interest]] | [[Everything okay?|okay_interest]]


:: how_long_marooned
I was stranded out there for three long days.
I mean, three risings and settings of Tau Ceti. Not totally sure how they mapped to Earth days.
But it was a good thing the White Star got my distress call and showed up when they did...
...'cause I don't know that I could've lasted another three MINUTES without their intervention.
But hey. It's Christmastime. The season of miracles, right?
[[So they say.|alien_talk]] | [[You were alone on that moon?|alone_moon]]


:: alien_talk
You'd be surprised what you start believing...
...when a White Star literally drops out of the sky and saves the day.
It might've been LESS surprising if a unicorn had showed up...
...and pooped a rainbow bridge back to Earth out of its hindquarters.
(Hell, once I get back to Earth, I might just tell people that's what DID happen.)
[[That should go over well.^Folks are always looking for solid news on unicorn sightings, these days.|unicorn_news]] | [[You could probably start a cult.|start_cult]]


:: sorry_woke
Yeah, well. Anytime I'm not dreaming about aliens...
...it's only because I'm not dreaming about them YET.
It always happens eventually.
Speaking of the klaxons, I should really go check on what's happening.
And speaking of the aliens... I really hope it's not the aliens.
Lemme just get out of these pajamas and...
Huh.
That's interesting.

:: how_long_home
<<set $mentionedtunguskite = true>>
I don't know exactly how long it'll take until we get back to Earth, honestly.
Mari -- she's the White Star's navigator -- has the course plotted, obviously.
I mean, that's her job, and I think she's usually pretty good at it.
But the problem is, the White Star's payload is throwing everything off.
I can... I'll try to explain. But later.
For right now... uh...

:: StoryTitle
Lifeline: Silent Night 110415


:: not_poem
Yeah, well, you'll have to forgive me. I'm a science student, not English lit.
And while I wasn't exactly dreaming of sugar plums (whatever THOSE are)...
...I WAS actually enjoying my first solid sleep since I got off that moon.
This was the first night I hadn't woken up in a cold sweat, thinking about the Varia crew...
...with those weird green eyes and their supernatural strength...
...and instead, I damn near fall out of my bunk when the proximity klaxon goes off.
[[Slow down. Explain.^I have no idea what you're talking about.|slow_down]] | [[Is this who I think it is?^This story sounds familiar. Are you... Taylor?|are_you_taylor]]


:: whos_this
Oh, hey, that was rude of me. Sorry.
My name's Taylor.
Student astronaut, formerly of the Varia. Which was formerly a ship.
Until it got yanked out of the void and smashed to flinders on a desert moon in the Tau Ceti system.
So I scuttled around like a hermit crab whose shell had been hammered open...
...until this mining ship, the White Star, was kind enough to swoop in to my rescue.
[[Well, that was lucky.|lucky_star]] | [[Oh, yeah! Taylor! I know you!|know_taylor]]


:: know_taylor
Cool! I thought your keystrokes sounded familiar.
Good to be back in touch with you!
[[You too! How you been?|how_you_been]] | [[How long were you marooned?|how_long_marooned]]


:: alone_moon
Well, I guess I wasn't technically ALONE.
I had Captain Aya, although she wasn't (and still isn't) conscious...
...and I had the four lab rats I'd brought with me, to run experiments on.
Oh, and then, y'know... the aliens.
Shouldn't forget about the aliens.
<<if $alienmention is false>>[[What, like, illegal immigrants?|illegal_aliens]] | [[Or do you mean actual ALIENS?|actual_aliens]]
<<elseif $alienmention is true>>[[Yeah, you'd mentioned that.|mentioned_aliens]] | [[Do you mean actual ALIENS?|actual_aliens]]

:: start_cult
Heh. Maybe so.
I always figured, the hardest part would be getting everyone to agree on the shoes.
A whole roomful of people who have to die in the same style of sneakers?
Sounds like a LOT of fashion arguments to have to deal w--
Huh.
That's interesting.
