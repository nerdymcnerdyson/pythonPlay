Please.

<<choice [[Uh... that <i>what</i> worked?|whatworked]]>> | <<choice [[What&apos;s happening here?|whatshappening]]>>

Oh. Oh, my God. I breached the veil.
I know you can't hear my voice, but... you can read my words?
You understand them?
<<choice [[Sure, I do, but...^Sure, I understand them... but I don't understand why I'm seeing them.|surebutwhy]]>> | <<choice [[Yeah, I read English.|ireadenglish]]>>


:: surebutwhy
Because I finally did it! After all the years, all the failures...
...all these scars...
...I finally broke through to you. I can hardly believe it.
I'm ashamed to think how close I was to giving up. To... to letting you go forever. Things got dark, for a while.
But now... now I'm one step closer to seeing your face again.
<<choice [[Wait... who do you think I am?|whodoyouthink]]>> | <<choice [[And who are <i>you?</i>^Look, before this gets any weirder... who, exactly, <i>are</i> you?|whoareyou]]>>


:: whoareyou
What do you mean, Who am I?
I'm your sister! I'm Ar--
No. Hold on. Names have power. I'm not just going to give mine away until I know what the hell is going on here.
I just completed a spell designed to pierce the Quintessence.
To take my spoken words, which would never be able to rise above the howls of the damned souls there...
...and turn them into printed text to be read by one person only.
The person I've been trying to reach for nearly a decade.
<<choice [[And that person is me?|thatpersonisme]]>> | <<choice [[I don&apos;t have a sister.^I think there's been some kind of mistake. I don't even have a sister.|nosisterofmine]]>>


:: thatpersonisme
I've been trying to reach my brother. Rand.
Please... tell me that's you.
<<choice [[Sorry, wrong number.^I don't know what to tell you... other than that I'm not your guy.|notyourguy]]>> | <<choice [[Oh. Yeah, sure, that&apos;s me.|imthatguy]]>>

You... you're not?
This isn't Rand?
<<choice [[No. Sorry.|imnotrand]]>> | <<choice [[Well, that <i>is</i> my name...^Actually, my name <i>does</i> happen to be Rand.|iamrand]]>>


:: thatsaplan
Oh. Whoops. I didn't mean to imply that I had a plan.
In my experience, the only thing plans are good for is so you have something to watch fall apart.
Plans are like gangrenous arms, in that respect.
<<choice [[That&apos;s a... pretty dim worldview.|yourehardcore]]>> | <<choice [[We see life differently.^Not to put too fine a point on it, but you're a real "glass half-empty" person, aren't you?|notsoeveryday]]>>


:: whycutting
I... look, I don't know how much of this I want to get into with you.
You're a total stranger. I contacted you by accident.
I mean, maybe you're nobody... or maybe you bent probability so my words would reach you. How could I be sure?
<<choice [[I'm not "nobody."^Everybody is somebody. Just because we've never met doesn't mean I'm a nonentity.|notnobody]]>> | <<choice [["Bent probability"? Huh?|bentprobability]]>>


:: bentprobability
Yeah, you know, warped the odds in favor of my communing with you? Caused my spell to go astray?
Lured me into a trap for your own nefarious purposes?
<<choice [[Pretty sure I didn&apos;t.|notatrap]]>> | <<choice [["Nefarious" isn't really my thing.^I've been called a lot of things by a lot of people, but "nefarious" has got to be a first.|nefarious]]>>


:: notsoeveryday
Aw, c'mon. I'm just like you. I get up in the morning, I put my pants on one leg at a time.
For as long as I still have both legs.
<<choice [[Dark. You&apos;re a dark person.|yourehardcore]]>> | <<choice [[So you're... a magician?^What you said earlier, about runes and charms... that's magic stuff, right?|youremagic]]>>


:: notatrap
...Yeah, I'm not getting the sense that you're a mage with those kind of power levels.
Or <i>any</i> kind of power levels, to be totally honest.
This link between us... this really is just pure chance, isn't it? Just serendipity?
<<choice [[Like that old John Cusack movie.|likecusack]]>> | <<choice [[We can&apos;t all be mages.^Sorry to disappoint, but not everyone can be a mage, you know.|notallmages]]>>


:: likecusack
Right. Except that movie was <i>way</i> more unbelievable than this situation.
(But yeah, I'd like to think of myself as a "Kate Beckinsale type.")
<<choice [[Wouldn't we all?|allbeckinsale]]>> | <<choice [[You're pretty pop-culture savvy.^You know a lot about old pop culture references for a... what are you, a witch?|popwitch]]>>


:: allbeckinsale
I've often thought, if I just had her wardrobe from <i>Underworld,</i> and her powers from <i>Underworld</i>...
...and her simple, relatable, down-to-earth problems from <i>Underworld</i>...
...how much easier my life would be.
<<choice [[You&apos;re pretty pop-culture savvy.^You know a lot about pop culture references for a... what are you, a witch?|popwitch]]>> | <<choice [[Too bad that's all fiction.^I guess it's a shame that vampires and werewolves and magic are all make-believe, then.|magicisntreal]]>>

:: questnearby
Miracle of miracles, I've spotted something!
There's a minivan parked on a side street.
I don't see anyone nearby that might be its owner. And sightlines to the van are poor.
If I thought they'd be back anytime soon, I might wait around and ask to hitch a ride...
...but who knows how long that could take?
<<if $darkness gte 75>>I think I should hotwire this thing. I've done it before. It's not that tricky.
<<elseif $darkness lte 74>>I could... I guess I could try hotwiring the van.
It doesn't exactly feel like the "right" thing to do... but it does feel like the <i>fast</i> thing to do.<<endif>>
Otherwise, I've got a long ways to walk. What do you think?
<<choice [[Walk it. Stealing is wrong.|takeahike]]>> | <<choice [[Hotwire the van. Let&apos;s go!|hotwireit]]>>


:: hotwireit
<<silently>><<darken 15>><<endsilently>>
All right. I guess we're gonna play <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> in real life.
Too bad I didn't bring a surplus of turtle shells...
...or we could play real-life <i>Mario Kart</i> once I get this thing running.
Just remember, you advised me to do this. You're aiding and abetting a felon.
<<choice [[Can you get into it?^Is the van unlocked, or do you have a way to break in to it?|breakin]]>> | <<choice [[I changed my mind.^You know what? When you put it that way, I think you should just walk, instead.|justwalk]]>>


:: breakin
Well, now, if I were my dad, I'd probably know all sorts of tech spells to get past the door lock...
...and to get the van started without having to crack open the steering column.
But instead, I'll have to-- Ha!
Oh, man. It was meant to be! This thing is a Nissan <i>Quest.</i>
What better vehicle to take on a quest?
Anyway. I'm wearing Converse, because I'm a very hip, old-school kind of teen witch.
And Converse have shoelaces, for, you know, lacing up your shoes.
And with a slipknot, and a little bit of elbow grease and ingenuity...
...I can get it through the window, pull up on the door lock, and <i>voila!</i>
We're inside the Quest, <<$playername>>!
<<choice [[A minivan. How thrilling.|minivanthrills]]>> | <<choice [[Move fast, you&apos;re breaking the law.|movefast]]>>


:: movefast
All right, so... I carry a few things with me at all times, because I never know when I'll need them.
In this case, it's Swiss Army knife, and specifically flathead screwdriver tool, to the rescue.
Just... gotta... get this steering column cover off... like so...
...and then parse all these wires.
Hang on a minute. If the owner's manual is in the glove box, that'll save me a ton of guesswork.
[[delay 2m|glovebox]]



:: thatsmyjam
Hey, I figure, if you're gonna break the law, you should at least have some tunes to back you up.
...Man, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sure do like to rhyme words with "California," don't they?
[[startthevan]]


:: coolhotwire
Nope! Everything is definitely <i>not</i> cool!
[[hotwirealarm]]


:: lanternvan
...and try to get my head clear and centered before I get to the curiosity shop.
I'll get back in touch once I'm there.

Awesome. My feet would write you a thank-you note, but their penmanship is just <i>awful.</i>
[[offtodestination]]


:: StoryTitle
Lifeline: Bloodline 081315


:: whatshappening
An answer.
It's... it's almost unbelievable. After all this time! I had almost given up.
But I've found you again. Unbelievable.
<<choice [[Given up on what?^You seem really excited, so I almost hate to ask, but... "given up" on what?|givenuponwhat]]>> | <<choice [[Found me "again"?^What do you mean, "again"? When did you find me before?|foundmeagain]]>>


:: ireadenglish
Right. Right. Of course you do.
Sorry. It's just... it's been so long. I can't help but still picture you as a child.
But of course you'd have grown. You'd have... changed, in there.
<<choice [[What are you talking about?|whatareyoutalkingabout]]>> | <<choice [[Who do you think I am?|whodoyouthink]]>>

You're... my...
I cast the spell to reach my brother, Rand.
Please... tell me that's who you are.
<<choice [[Not exactly.|imnotrand]]>> | <<choice [[Uh, sure, I&apos;m your brother.|imthatguy]]>>


:: nosisterofmine
You don't...?
This... isn't just some sort of cruel trick, is it? This isn't Rand, force-fed on lotus petals to forget the past?
You... oh, God, you actually aren't him, are you?
<<choice [[Sorry, no. I&apos;m not.|imnotrand]]>> | <<choice [["Force-fed on lotus petals"?|forcefedlotus]]>>


:: imnotrand
...No.
No, of <i>course</i> you're not. Why should anything go the way it's supposed to? Ever?
<<if $simple is 0>>Just because I spent everything I had on this stupid dagger. Just because I carved these stupid runes in my arm.<<endif>>
It's probably not even really a charmed knife. I bet I didn't summon anything more intimidating than tetanus.
<<choice [[You should see a doctor.|seeadoctor]]>> | <<choice [[What were you attempting?^What exactly were you trying to do, with all this cutting?|whycutting]]>>


:: youcaughtme
...Why would you try to trick me? You heard the part about me casting a spell, didn't you?
I could turn you into a... a toad. Or a horned toad. Or some kind of... I don't know. Toad.
I'm pretty tired right now.
Anyway, you should be terrified of my magical abilities.
<<choice [[Magic isn't real.^Sorry. I can't be scared of magic when I know it's all smoke and mirrors.|magicisntreal]]>> | <<choice [[So you're, what, a witch?|areyouawitch]]>>


:: seeadoctor
Yeah. Solid advice.
Only problem is that "runaway teen sorceress" doesn't come with a great benefits package, you know?
I figure, if my arm turns gangrene, I'll just hack it off and cauterize the wound with fire.
I mean, it's my left arm. I barely use it for anything.
<<choice [[That's... a plan, I guess.|thatsaplan]]>> | <<choice [[Kind of extreme, isn't it?|kindaextreme]]>>


:: kindaextreme
Nah. "Extreme" is drinking a Mountain Dew and skateboarding down a stairway railing.
Chopping off your own arm? Just one of those everyday annoyances.
<<choice [[You&apos;re pretty hardcore.|yourehardcore]]>> | <<choice [[Your "everyday" differs from mine.|notsoeveryday]]>>


:: magicifyouwant
<<if visited() eq 1>>Oh, I do want. I want very much.
This is sort of a consolation prize, though, at this point.
On account of, you know, all the blood. Which wasn't involved in hitchhiking.
But <i>whatever.</i>
So, if you'll excuse me a minute, I've got to cut teensy-tiny symbols into my fingers...
...and then lace my teensy-tiny fingers together and fire up that warp spell.
<<elseif visited() gte 2>>Damn right, that's what I want.
If I don't get to sit on my butt and enjoy some tunes and some air conditioning...
...then at the very least, I should get to poke myself with a Swiss Army knife...
...smoosh myself through time and space, and then puke from the aftereffects.
Clearly the next best thing to riding shotgun in a Lexus.<<endif>>
[[delay 3m^Arika is preparing|warptime]]


:: tryquest
All right, then. The Quest it is.
Let's see if I can bring this miracle of Japanese engineering back from the nearly-dead.
Ignition wires, let me just reintroduce you to battery wires...
...and then we'll throw in Mr. Starter Wire, and now it's really a party!
Annnnnnd...
...we have forward motion! Let's get this show on the road!
[[delay 5m^Arika is driving|brokedown]]


:: yourehardcore
Relax. I have yet to chop off an arm.
I've got plenty of scars all over the arms that are still attached.
But you probably don't wanna hear about that.
<<choice [[True. I&apos;ve got my own problems.|myownproblems]]>> | <<choice [[Go ahead, lay it on me.|talkitout]]>>


:: youremagic
That is magic stuff. Correct.
Why? Does that bother you?
<<choice [[No. I know magic's not real.|magicisntreal]]>> | <<choice [[So, you're... a witch?|areyouawitch]]>>


:: notallmages
Yeah, only the "lucky" few like me.
(Did it come across that I was being super-sarcastic when I said "lucky"?)
Trust me, you're better off being an absolute nobody than being a magic-user in this day and age.
<<choice [["Absolute nobody"? Uh, <i>ouch.</i>|notnobody]]>> | <<choice [[Beats being some stuck-up witch.^If being witch means having a crappy attitude like yours, I&apos;m fine the way I am, thanks.|areyouawitch]]>>


:: popwitch
Well, <i>sure</i> I do.
What did you think, that I've spent the last decade with my head in the sand, ignorant of movie theaters and DVDs?
Not while there are Ryan Goslings and Mark Ruffalos running around with their shirts off!
What's the old saying? "A girl cannot survive on basic cable alone."
...Oh, and I'm not a <i>witch,</i> thanks.
[[areyouawitch]]


:: foundquest
Miracle of miracles, I've spotted something!
There's a minivan parked at a rest area off the side of the road.
I don't see its owners anywhere nearby... maybe they hiked off to find a picnic spot...
...or a make-out spot...
...or maybe I should stop imagining that the minivan people are leading far more interesting lives than mine.
(They <i>are</i> minivan people, after all.)
If I thought they'd be back anytime soon, I might wait around and ask to hitch a ride...
...but who knows how long that could take?
<<if $darkness gte 75>>I think I should hotwire this thing. I've done it before. It's not that tricky.
<<elseif $darkness lte 74>>I could... I guess I could try hotwiring the van.
It doesn't exactly feel like the "right" thing to do... but it does feel like the <i>fast</i> thing to do.<<endif>>

<<choice [[Walk it. Stealing is wrong.|takeahike]] | <<choice [[Hotwire the van. Let&apos;s go!|hotwireit]]>>


:: justwalk
<<silently>><<darken -12>><<endsilently>>
Ugghhh.
I'm going to sigh deeply, and then I'm going to admit that, from a moral standpoint, you're probably right.
I guess I don't really want this thing weighing on my conscience the whole time, do I?
Fine. Fine fine ugghhh fine. I'll walk instead. Fine.
Let me just reprogram my expectations of climate-controlled comfort, annnnnd...
[[takeahike]]


:: minivanthrills
Hey, maybe I want to do some Soccer Mom cosplay. You ever consider that?
Breaking into a minivan is about as close to a "normal" life as I've ever come.
(There is something unutterably sad about that last sentence.)
[[movefast]]

Okay, cool. Battery wires are red, ignition is white...
...strip a little insulation, twist, spark, and...
<i>Yes!</i> Radio's on! I've got the greatest hits of the '80s, '90s, and today!
<<choice [[Lucky you.|thatsmyjam]]>> | <<choice [[But can you start the van?|startthevan]]>>


:: startthevan
If I can get the starter wire to cooperate with me -- very carefully -- then...
...we're in business! The Quest is on, which means my quest is on!
It, uh... it probably bears mentioning that another thing that's on is the "Empty" light on the gas gauge.
<<if $currentquest is "lantern">>So let's hope we've got enough fumes to get to the antiques shop...
<<elseif $currentquest is "ribbon">>So let's hope we've got enough fumes to get to Floodland...

...because I can't afford to fill this sucker up.
And if there's a way to make unleaded gas appear out of thin air, I sure don't know it.
<<choice [[Well, good luck driving.^You've gone to all the effort of hotwiring it, you might as well drive it as long as you can.|drivefornow]]>> | <<choice [[Maybe you should walk, then.^If you're that close to empty, maybe it makes more sense just to hoof it.|walkfornow]]>>

Wow. That was an exciting thrill ride from start to finish!
The needle on the gas gauge just kept pushing deeper and deeper into the red.
I was certain that, at any moment, the Quest would start shaking...

<<if $currentquest is "lantern">>But instead, here we are in an alley, a block away from Kildecatt's Curiosities.

You know, what with all the murderers these days.
Anyway, I could be jutting my thumb out for a while before I even <i>see</i> a car...

(Oregon is nice and granola, and lets you walk on the freeway, but hitching <i>is</i> still illegal.)

Yeah, good stuff. I'll throw my thumb in the air, and wave it like I just don't care.
Maybe I should magic up some giant thumbs, like Uma Thurman in <i>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.</i>
You know, I think they actually filmed that around here.
Anyway. I think I'm gonna go silent for a bit, while I stroll along and try to catch a ride.
I'm going to mentally cast myself in various Uma Thurman roles while I walk.
Oh, look, there's me in <i>Gattaca!</i> I am following the rules!
All right. I'll get hold of you if anything interesting goes down.

What were you picturing, some crazy old lady on a broomstick?
Green skin, warty nose, susceptible to buckets of water thrown by Kansas farm girls in shiny red shoes?
I guaran-damn-tee you, I'm none of those things.

Right, okay, you're right. We're all special and unique snowflakes.
I just... forgive me if I seem a little edgy. It's just that I've been on the edge for, oh, about ten years now.
And I've figured out, over time, that the best way to keep my balance is not to reach out for anyone or anything.
So trying to contact my brother... it was a huge leap of faith.
And -- not surprisingly -- faith let me fall flat on my stupid face.

It's pronounced "ARR-uh-kuh" but everyone says it like "Erica" so I've learned to just smile and accept it.

It's... actually kind of nice to know who's on the other end of this spell.
To not feel like I'm just tossing these words into the void, you know?
To have a... a <i>connection.</i>
I, uh... I don't have a lot of occasion to use the word "appreciate" these days.
I sort of worry that I've forgotten how to even pronounce it.

<<elseif $backstory is 0>>The CliffsNotes version of my backstory -- which is more than I share with most people -- goes something like this:
So about ten years back, I watched my parents die in front of me, and when I tried to help...
...I opened a portal to a nightmare dimension called the Quintessence that swallowed my little brother Rand...
...oh, and when I reached for him, the portal snapped shut, cutting me off from him completely...
...so that I've been wandering the Pacific Northwest for nearly a decade, surviving on my wits...
...trying to amass enough mystical power to reclaim my home, rescue my brother, or die in the attempt.
Good times, huh?<<endif>>

...Yeah, well, I guess you're not wrong.
I'm headed back to where I grew up. Where everything went wrong. A little town in Washington state called New Tenacity.
Don't bother looking for it on any maps; you won't find it. That's by design.
It's an enclave of magic-users who sequestered ourselves a little bit away from the rest of society...
...we built a town in the woods where no one would bother us.
Or, at least, that was the <i>plan.</i>

I could've buffed the cuticle. Could've evened out the tan.
A little foundation to cover the sigil scars.
Man... now that I really look at it, this thumb is a <i>disaster.</i>

Besides, at this point I'm not even convinced that Carter <i>does</i> have any sort of "magic detector."

Just spreading the <i>rumor</i> that you've got a magic detector, and hoping that scares people into not using magic.
<<elseif $darkness lte 50>>I'm not too sure about this... but then again, maybe I'm worried for nothing.
Maybe Carter just started a <i>rumor</i> that he has some sort of "magic detector" in place, to intimidate people.

Kildecatt's isn't exactly bustling at the moment.
Portland has such weird zoning laws that you can plunk an artifact-laden antique shop like this...
...right down in between a daycare and a topless bar, and nobody bats an eye.
Most of the stuff in this shop is <i>fascinating.</i> Utterly incredible, utterly unique.
And in some cases, astronomically powerful.
So Carter Miles did the smartest thing I can imagine: He put all his enthralling merchandise on display...
...right in the heart of a city that prides itself on being kooky and weird...
...and now nobody even gives these things a second glance.
He's hiding in plain sight, making a few bucks on a good day... it's pretty ingenious.

Hey. I was looking -- great store you've got here, by the way, lots of cool stuff --

I heard this was the place to come for one-of-a-kind items.

I could feel Ratliff leave my brain, and then he sort of staggered behind the counter and...

In a <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> wastepaper bin, if you're keeping score at home.
And now he and Carter are shooting one another meaningful glances.
Like, whatever you <i>used</i> to have in your mental dictionary under "meaningful glance"...

Good news is, I found a five-dollar bill wadded up in the gutter on the main road through town.
You spend enough time on the streets, you get kind of a sixth sense for free money.
(Plus I may have also had a free money locator hex running, which is a lot like cheating.)
I took that bad boy to the closest convenience store, and that's where the bad news kicks in:
Did you know they discontinued Fiery Habanero Doritos?
Like, <i>years</i> ago, apparently?
I get that I've been living rough for a long time, but seriously, people...

Well, I ran through the briars, and I ran through the brambles...

...and I had a Johnny Horton song stuck in my head for the last two hours.
Which, I'm pretty sure, counts as cruel and unusual punishment.
I think I just violated the Geneva Conventions on myself.
But it doesn't matter. Because I'm here, now, at the monastery gates.
And things are already feeling kinda strange.
[[monasterygates]]


:: carterinfo
Let me tell you a little about the guy who runs the place, just so you know what we're getting into.
Dude's name is Carter Miles. He's got a sharp eye and a fast mouth.
He collects objects of interest from all over the globe. 
Some stuff that's really ancient, like Aztec pottery or Inverted Jenny stamps...
...and other stuff that's just collectible, like rare lunchboxes, or Lego figures from Comic-Con.
He's especially intrigued by one-of-a-kind stuff.
The guy drives a hard bargain. Prides himself that he always gets the better end of the deal.
<<choice [[So, what's your plan?^If that's the case, how do you intend to get the upper hand?|upperhand]]>> | <<choice [[How much money have you got?|howmuchcash]]>>


:: upperhand
Every Achilles has a heel, and this guy is no different.
It's a poorly kept secret that he's got a tiny little (HUGE) gambling problem.
Word is, he takes the day's profits out of the cash register...
...and antes up in a couple different underground card games.
And when that money runs out, sometimes he'll start selling his goods... <i>way</i> below their value.
So with luck on our side and not his, we'll catch him on a downswing...
...and nab the lantern for a song.
<<choice [[Your plan is "hope we're lucky?"|luckyplan]]>> | <<choice [[Can't you use magic?^Couldn't you use a spell of some sort, to turn the odds in your favor?|magicodds]]>>


:: whatsinside
It honestly might be faster to list the stuff that <i>isn't</i> in here.
He's got everything from Depression-era glassware to <i>No Depression</i>-era Uncle Tupelo autographs...
...about a hundred different nativity scenes, so about three hundred wise men...
...a wall full of globes, <i>most</i> of which seem to be of Earth...
...and little piles of Americana dating back to before there even <i>was</i> an America.
You could spend a week in this place and not see everything there is to see.
<<choice [[But we don&apos;t have a week.|notaweek]]>> | <<choice [[Have you spotted the lantern?|lanternthere]]>>


:: notaweek
You don't have to tell <i>me</i> that.
The problem is, for the most part, things aren't organized into sections.
It's not like all the lamps are on one shelf, subdivided into "gas" or "electric" or "magical."
They're spread out all over. It's enough to drive a shopper to madness.

:: magicodds
Maybe. But it might be tricky.
See, Carter's no dummy. He's been dealing in magical artifacts for centuries.
And not everyone who comes by to browse is as... scrupulous as we are.
So, rumor has it, Carter wised up and put some kind of detection system in place.
<<choice [[Like, a smoke detector for magic?|magicdetector]]>> | <<choice [[Can it be deactivated?|deactivated]]>>


:: deactivated
That's the thing... there's no reliable info on what the means of detection <i>is.</i>
Whether he's got a charm over the building, or each individual item in it...
...or maybe a protective spell over himself.
Or even some sort of, I don't know, meteorological device that reads magically charged particles in the air.
That's why I stopped a whole city block away from the place. Can't be too careful.
But I also can't spend all day by this Dumpster, making semi-educated guesses...
...so let's go pay a visit to Kildecatt's, what do you say?
<<choice [[I'm in! Let's do this.|gotoshop]]>> | <<choice [[Hold back for a minute.^Maybe you should play it cool for a bit... just to make sure he hasn&apos;t detected your magic.|hangback]]>>

Gosh, I don't know where the nearest food is.

Her name was Leila Grace, and there was something... just... <i>wrong</i> about her.
It was subtle. The sort of thing I didn't notice right away, and most people didn't notice at all.

Because I knew, she damn sure wasn't going to get the help she needed there.
I had no business being on my own, much less trying to take care of her.
I was only a kid myself then. Eleven years old. But I wanted to protect her, if I could.

Think of magic as a coin with two sides. It sounds simplistic, but bear with me.
As a mage, you're <i>constantly</i> spending that coin. Because every spell has a cost.
Me, my family, my whole lineage... we practice blood magic.
It's not too hard to look at my scars and figure out what my cost is.

:: worsethanscars
When you start playing around with the dark arts... that's when you're digging deep.
Cutting open new wounds before the old ones even start to heal. Spending more of that coin than you have.
Swearing you'll pay it back but knowing you never will.
That's the thing about magic, though... it balances its own scales. It takes its share.
And if you can't cover the price... it'll take it out of someone else.
Someone you care about.
That's why I've spent the last few months shedding friends, cutting ties. Going it alone.
And that... that's what makes me scared.
Because -- apart from my brother, out there in the void -- the only someone I care about anymore...
...is <i>you.</i>

Because my memories of New Tenacity are so much worse.
Floodland... it'll be like a trial run. If I can make it through this, then I'll know...

I need some immediate paid time off so I can go on vacation to this creepy orphanage.
Hold all my calls.
...Anyway. About Floodland.
[[waitingatfloodland]]


:: helpleila2
I tried.
When I ran away from Floodland, I broke a couple of other kids out with me.
And even though Leila was way younger, and I knew she was only going to slow me down...
...I <i>begged</i> her to come with me. Pleaded with her.
Because I knew, she damn sure wasn't going to get the help she needed there.
I had no business being on my own, much less trying to take care of her.
I was only a kid myself then. Eleven years old. But I wanted to protect her, if I could.
Try to figure out her powers, what they were and why they seemed to be taking such a toll on her.
[[timetogo]]


:: howwrong2
That's just it... to this day, I'm not sure I could define it, exactly.
The word I've settled on, after having had years to mull it over...
...is <i>haunted.</i>
I think that Leila had, somehow, gotten a look beyond the veil...
...a look at the lost souls swirling, unmoored, in the Quintessence...
...and that she'd brought just a little of it back to live inside her head.

I was just as likely to... to lose as to win. I knew that going in.
Maybe... I don't know, maybe there's a way to see my plan through, without the lantern.
Maybe I can rethink this whole thing.
I just need to walk out of here, with my chin held high instead of quivering...

The end of that sentence is, "...unless she <i>isn't</i> controlling it."

It was a rich, deep-dark blue, back when this building was new.

Not from what I remember. I mean, obviously, they could've changed things since I was here.

I guess they were meant to keep the boys calm and subdued --
unlike all those hot, racy nuns, with their habits and wimples and frowns.
It was the interior design equivalent of saltpeter, basically.

Anyway, the point is, in order to pull off this Great Darts Caper...
...I, naturally, enchanted one of the darts.
[[enchanteddart]]

Made a tiny mark on the barrel, so that I knew it was the right one.

...and then I can finally be rid of this stupid binding of dead leaves!
And once that's done, it turns out the dart is <i>sharp</i> and can be <i>thrown.</i>

I just have to give the spiders a few minutes to work, and then I'll be free of this binding...
<<elseif $spideracquire is 0>>All right. Little symbols on my fingertips, little words under my breath...

There are mages who do that. Who walk the path of the light, and never stray.

I... all right. So, like, when I talked about warps and wefts... that's dark magic.
You're ripping open reality. Creating wounds in the fabric of spacetime.
And reality -- like anything else -- feels pain when it gets wounded.
Which is why that sort of thing gives me pause.
Because the more a mage indulges in the dark arts, the more people and things feel pain.
And the more that mage's soul gets chipped away, piece by tiny piece...

Heading left... like I did every night after dinner, for waaay longer than I like to think about.
The hallway seems smaller now, somehow. And sadder, if that's even possible.
I don't think there've been any touch-ups done since I left.
Same wallpaper. Same sconces. Same wainscoting.
Same portraits of nuns and novices who once worked here, now deceased, with--

Well, I mean, so there are new portraits of dead women, ones that weren't here when I was...

...but that makes sense. People die.
People around Floodland appear to die in disproportionate numbers, but fine, whatever.
No, what's new -- and creepy as hell, the longer I look at it --
is that they've all got their eyes cut out.

Sorry, sorry. Okay, so, once upon a time in the miserable kingdom of Floodland...
...we used to have a dartboard down in the great room.
<<if $greatroom is 1>>I didn't think about it when I was down there earlier...
...for the simple reason that the board's not there anymore.<<endif>>
The Sisters eventually removed it, on account of darts being associated with pubs...

Even though no Floodland kid was in any danger of having a drink, much less of having fun.
But! While the board <i>was</i> here, we came about as close to fun as we ever did.
And your pal Arika Lanphear, it turned out, was pretty darn good at tossing darts.

Drab, olive-green wallpaper, the same color as the chalkboards...

(May have had something to do with all the sweat socks. Just a theory.)
It always seemed dirtier than the girls' hall. Rowdier. But also friendlier, maybe.
There was, like, this shadow economy of smuggled-in comic books.
The boys would pass these things around amongst themselves, under the Sisters' noses...
...reading them until they fell apart. Then Scotch-taping them and reading 'em again.

because the stairs were constructed fully out of wood. No nails, no screws... only wood dowels.

While I was here... not long after Leila arrived, in fact...
this kid fell down the stairs in the middle of the night. Broke the railing.

They don't turn around. They don't leave impressions in the food.
They just disappear. Like the walker -- like, let's just say it, <i>Leila</i> --

Yeah, okay. I guess I've really only alluded to them, up to this point.
There was a family who arrived in town. Called themselves the Greens.
A young couple, with a baby. Novice mages. They didn't seem to know much magic.
Just enough to have nosed out where New Tenacity was hidden away.
They were dirt-poor when they showed up. Nothing to their names.
The town -- my folks in particular -- took pity on them.
I mean, we've all been there, right?
Or we all got there eventually.

And behind them -- sweeping down on them, crashing toward us --

Yeah? I'm not so sure.

...<i>gone.</i>
[[taleoftenacity]]

It was a couple of things, actually.
One was the rumbling sound of three hundred possessed townspeople --
possessed <i>mages</i> -- marching toward my family's home.
And the other thing was more ambient, more pervasive...
...and I didn't understand what it was until later, until I was running away.
It was the sound of the forest itself. The trees, the vegetation, the woods...
...groaning and creaking and splitting as it overgrew the edges of our town.
Screaming and stretching as it swallowed up the outskirts of New Tenacity...
...and began shooting its vines and tendrils through houses and shops.
Through churches and libraries. Through buildings and roads.
Through people.
Possessed foliage snaking through possessed people...
...the shrieks of the woods as loud as the screams of the men. The women.
The children.

We were bleary-eyed, in our pajamas, trying to figure out what was happening...
...and there were the Greens. All three of them.
Just sitting together on our living room couch, like they were posing for a snapshot.
Calm, cool, collected. Green-eyed.
And then, all three of them opened their mouths -- even the baby --
and at the same time, with one voice, they said,
"We have found what we need here. And so we will take it."
And then...
...oh, God, I don't even want to think about it.

They'd make a doorway back into the Quintessence... like I've been trying to do for a decade.
But I screwed up. I didn't get everything I needed. Or <i>anything</i> I needed.
I destroyed the Greens. Or at least, the ones at New Tenacity.

I can feel my consciousness slip out of my body and into the air around me. 
(There is <i>definitely</i> magic here already. Powerful magic.)
My mind glides into the lock mechanism -- it's so simple.
All I have to do is push these little pin thingies and...

I have to wonder, though. Was it really a good idea to use magic to do this? 
I'd've wound up with bloody fingers either way, and this method is certainly faster...
...but it costs more. Metaphysically speaking.
Maybe I should have just climbed over the fence, pointy things or no.

That would mean that the tree had been here for at least a hundred years.

(No. I have no idea what "boffo" means.)
There was a weird twisty feeling, and all these passageways just kind of... merged... into one.
And at the end of the one passageway there's a door.

So here's what just happened.
As I reached up to grab the key, a hand appeared from nowhere and took it from me!
I looked and all I could see was a human-like form, bathed in iridescent light.
Everything was swirling. I could barely see or hear.
The person -- I'm assuming it was a person -- looked over its shoulder at me as it walked away.
It said, in a voice I could barely recognize as human, it was so distorted:
"Back in two shakes, Arika."
Back in two shakes.
Then it took the key, and it vanished.
I don't know who was more surprised, me or the monks.
For a magically elongated instant, we just stood there looking at each other like idiots.
Then suddenly the person was back, only this time even more swirly than before.
"Here you go," it said in that same distorted voice. "Be careful with this."
And handed me the key. 
Just like that. The whole thing took maybe three seconds. And then the person was gone.
And now here I am, holding the key, surrounded by what I can only assume are a dozen very angry monks.
They're closing in on me. Did I mention they look really angry?

I would say you're not going to believe this...
...but I honestly don't know if you've believed anything I've told you yet.
I'm standing in front of the monastery. 
Correction. I'm standing in front of where the monastery <i>used</i> to be.
When I hauled ass out of there, I threw a bunch of the machinery behind me...
...you know, to keep the monks from following me.
There were some pretty amazing sparks. A weird light filled the room.
The monks looked very gravely concerned. I'm pretty sure I broke something very important.
I was running so fast I barely noticed...
...but even at that breakneck speed, I could see something weird going on.
Like everything was accelerating around me. The whole world turning blue.
Everything got all flat and two-dimensional. I felt heavy, like I was made of lead.
I could feel the speed spell -- what little there was of it -- wearing off before I reached the narthex.
By the time I made it to the front door of the abbey, there <i>was</i> no more abbey!
I looked back and saw what I'm seeing now --
an enormous ruin, a jumbled pile of weathered stones in the middle of the Oregon forest.
The monastery is gone. And so is my key.
This is bad.
I'm going to get some sleep and...
...I don't know what. Try to figure out what to do next.

Okay, fine. I guess this counts as self-defense if anything does.
One of them is coming at me, still painfully slow.
<<if $fabuladagger>><<set $weapon = "dagger">><<else>><<set $weapon = "knife">><<endif>>
I whipped out the <<$weapon>> and made a warning swipe, hoping just to brush him back, right?
But instead he just <i>lunged</i> into it, grabbing for the key.
<monk>You must not! That is the heart of God!</monk>
My knife went right into his belly, slicing him open.
And -- oh, this just gets weirder and weirder! Come on!

:: keytowergotkeyrun [key]
I think I can make it -- they're not quite moving quickly enough to stop me.
I'm going to run for it.

:: keytowerspellrouletteworked [key]
As soon as I started spellcasting, the monks came at me. But it was strange.
It was like they were... scared.
They leapt on me, knocked me down, but I kept on working the spell as best I was able. 
I was pretty sure it wouldn't work.
But guess what?
It worked.
Wonders never cease.
[[keytowertriggerspell]]


:: keytowerspellroulettefail [key]
Unsurprisingly, the spell didn't work like I'd hoped.
I mean, it sort of worked. But I have a feeling when I say the trigger, it's not going to be so great.
[[keytowerspellfailed]]


:: keytowerintegratemonks [key]
Okay, I'm not necessarily saying no, but... what do you mean by "integrated"?
Because in this context, that sounds bad.
<monk>As we did with Clepsydra, we will dissect your physical form and distribute it among ourselves.</monk>
Holy hell!
He's lifing up his robe, and pulling back a flap and -- maybe I shouldn't be too surprised at this point --
but these monks are straight up robots.
[[You can say "no" now.|keytowernothanksintegrate]] | [[Time to fight your way out!|keytowerfailknife]]


:: keytowermonkrobot [key]
I don't know how to say this, but these monks?
They are <i>robots.</i> Or something. Because they have lots of little clockwork bits.
But the thing is that these clockwork bits are also wired into human parts.
Really desiccated, decaying human parts.
Close enough to robots for me to not be too concerned about what I'm about to do.
[[delay 5m^Arika is fighting|keytowermonksdead]]


:: keytowerfailknife [key]
I can try. The monks are surrounding me, but they're not holding on to me. 
I can tell they're ready to step in if I try anything funny, though.
Not sure if attempting to work magic is a good idea right now.
[[Might as well go for it.|keytowerfailattack]] | [[Knives have other uses.|keytowerfailknifeuses]]


:: keytowernothanksintegrate [key]
That's very flattering, but I'd prefer to remain all in one piece, if that's okay.
<monk>As you wish, though it would be a great honor for all of us for you to integrate, as we did with Clepsydra.</monk>
Okay, he's pointing inside his chest cavity...
...and I can see that there are a bunch of gears and cogs and stuff --
-- but all this stuff is attached via copper tubing to a heart. A <i>human</i> heart, I'm guessing.
<monk>I was fortunate enough to receive this.</monk>
And now he's looking at the other monks.

<<silently>><<darken 10>><<endsilently>>
I just killed twelve robots.
I feel pretty good about it, but also kind of terrible about it.
It's hard to explain how I feel about it.
I'm just staring at a pile of bodies, telling myself they're fake.
I'm mostly buying it.
I'm leaving now.
[[delay 1m^Arika is walking|keytowerwalkedwithkey]]


:: keytowerranwithkey [key]
I don't believe it. I'm free. I made it!
It took some leaping and dodging --
and I think I may have sprained both ankles and a wrist coming down that spiral staircase at speed.
Speaking of speed, the spell is just wearing off, and boy, am I going to have a headache.
But I'm miles away from the monastery. And I have the key!
Maybe the monks will come after me for it? I don't know, and right now I don't care.
Time for a well-deserved rest.
[[delay 10h^Arika is resting|keyend]]


:: keytowerfailknifeuses [key]
I don't think attacking the monks right now is going to accomplish much.

I don't believe it. I'm free. I made it!
I feel really weird inside.

:: keytowerjoin [key]
Okay, let's say I join you. What exactly will you do for me?
<monk>That depends on you.</monk>
<monk>If you wish to join us, study our teachings, you will someday become more powerful than you can imagine.</monk>
<monk>Were that the case, it would be a trivial thing to return to New Tenacity and avenge yourself.</monk>
<monk>Alternately, you could supply us with something we require, and we would offer you a favor in return.</monk>
What do you require? Dare I ask?
<monk>Not much. A kidney. Your gall bladder. A lung. Nothing you cannot survive without.</monk>
Annnnd, he's lifting up his robes. Yikes.
[[Join them.^Maybe they can teach you something, or at least you can escape later.|keytowersignup]] | [[Give up a kidney.^They seem to know their way around a human body, at least.|keytowertrade]]


:: keytowerfailattack
I'm not sure if I agree that was the best plan, but I took the knife out anyway.
And was immediately attacked by all twelve monks.
They move so fast compared to me, I can't defend myself.
They're hurting me... really bad.
I can feel my bones shatter --
my organs being pierced.
So much pain.
So efficiently delivered.

Huh. Amazing what a little beauty sleep and a works-while-you-wait healing spell can accomplish.
All right. That's over with. I guess it's time to get a move on.

:: keytowertrade [key]
Okay, I'm willing to trade a kidney for a favor. But just one kidney. And I get to pick the favor.
<i>And</i> the kidney.
(The monks are looking at each other. It's eerily silent.)
<monk>It is acceptable. If it is within our power to provide.</monk>
I think it is. All I'm asking for is a little time travel.
<monk>That is within our power... in a sense.</monk>
Okay, <<$playername>>. I need to work things out with these monks. I'll get back to you.
[[delay 10h^Arika is undergoing surgery|gottagetbackintime]]

Okay, I'll join you. Let's do it.
<monk>We are pleased that you have so chosen. You will not regret this decision.</monk>

<<silently>><<darken -100>><<endsilently>>
Sorry that took so long.
But you'll never guess where I am. I'm in New Tenacity!
And what's more, you'll never guess <i>when</i> I am!
Ten years ago, that's when!
The monks brought me to some hidden room beneath the dorter...
...drugged me up, and then I guess they nicked a kidney.
I say "I guess" because I'm not just in my nine-year-old life --
I'm in my nine-year-old body, too.
They sent me back in time. That was my favor. To back before it even started.
To warn my parents. To keep my brother from ever going to the Quintessence.
I'm standing in my front yard. My brother... oh, my God, my brother's at the door.
<rand>Why're you looking at me funny, Arika?</rand>
Rand? Is that really you?
<rand>Stop being weird, Arika.</rand>
My mom is in the kitchen, I can see her through the window. She looks so young!
<rand>Who are you talking to, you freakazoid?</rand>
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
<rand>You better come inside, Arika. It's getting late. Mom's gonna be mad.</rand>
Mom. Right. There's something I have to tell mom! Right away!
<rand>What is it?</rand>
It's really important! Only I... I can't remember what it is!
<rand>Oh my god, you are such a dork, Arika!</rand>
Shut up! I am not!
<rand>Whatever. If it was really important, you'll remember later.</rand>
But it was... I know it was really...
Rand, stop looking at me like that! You are such a butthole!
<rand>Mom, she called me a butthole!</rand>
I'm sure I'll remember. It <i>was</i> something really important.
It was about... something... green?
Oh, well.
Mom! Tell him to leave me alone!
[[goodbye]]


:: keytowerarikajoined
Sorry for the delay.
For you it's been a few hours, but in that time I've spent <i>years</i> studying with the Timeless Monks.
At first I thought I would just listen to them and wait for a chance to escape.
But then I realized they had a lot to teach me...
...so I listened and learned, thinking I could use their magic to save my brother.
But then I had a revelation.
I realized the truth of the clockwork deity. I came to accept that we are but cogs in his plan.
I am a cog. My brother is a cog. My parents were cogs, long since discarded by the mechanism.
All proceeds according to the order set down by God.
<<if $buildGod>>And we are building God. Together.<<endif>>
<<if $sendGod>>And we are sending God back to create the Universe anew. Not this Universe. A better one.<<endif>>
I have appreciated your help. But it is no longer required.
Goodbye.
[[goodbye]]
