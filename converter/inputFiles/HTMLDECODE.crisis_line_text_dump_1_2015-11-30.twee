I just pulled up to the crime scene.
The d-bag neighbor is gone, presumably to work, leaving his shell-shocked wife to watch over the cops in his absence.
Jason Leder is no longer lying by the side of the pool, having been taken to the morgue.
Otherwise, things look like they did when I left.
The lead criminalist, Cordelia Wiseman, just saw me and is heading this way. She looks irritated.
I'll put the app on speech-to-text mode, like before.
<<d "secondary">>Hey, Esposito. Thanks for the fun crime scene.<<endd>>
<<d "rob">>I keep asking the murderers to commit their crimes in sterile environments but I haven't had any takers yet.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>Well, get on that. This isn't any fun at all.<<endd>>
<<d "rob">>What can you tell me?<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>Right now? Not much.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>We skimmed the pool and did a fifty-foot sweep, but it's outdoors, it's windy. This scene is a loser.<<endd>>
<<d "rob">>Hang on. I'm just going to take some quick notes on my phone.<<endd>>
This is me typing.
Anything I should ask her?

Good idea. Cordelia's not a pathologist, but she's been doing this for a long time.
<<d "rob">>Did you notice anything about the body? Guess at how exactly he died?<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>He didn't drown, I can tell you that much.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>No flecking around the lips, and the EMTs said there was no water in his lungs when they went to resuscitate.<<endd>>
<<d "rob">>Got it. Any guesses about how he got so beat up?<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>He's got tons of lacerations on his arms and face, and then a bunch of blunt force trauma to boot.<<endd>>

<<d "secondary">>It's really impossible to say at this point.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>If I had to guess, I'd say someone beat the snot out of him someplace nearby and dumped him here.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>Maybe they wanted to muddy the evidence -- in which case, excellent job -- or maybe they weren't sure if he was dead.<<endd>>
<<d "secondary">>Or maybe this is a message to the homeowner.<<endd>>

We're here now at the edge of the driveway.
I should say, "one of the edges of the driveway." 
It's one of those kind that loops around in front of the house with an entrance and an exit.
The gate that leads to the pool is right off the driveway where it loops closest to the house.
I guess rich people can't be bothered to put their cars in reverse?
Hey, if you live here and always valet when you go out, you'd <i>never have to</i>.

There's something not quite right.
If you wanted to dump a body, it only <i>sort of</i> makes sense to do it here.
The river is right there.
If the killer had dumped the body in the river, it'd be washed up against Tom Miller Dam by now. Out of sight.
Why dump the body <i>here</i>?
There's something else, but I can't work out what it is.

Yes! That's it!
<<print $player>>, you're a genius!
This is what's been bothering me:
I can't see a killer driving his car all the way to the end of the driveway here, then pulling a body out of his trunk.
The gate to the pool is right along the driveway, where it comes closest to the house.
Why stop your car here and drag your victim--dead or dying--all the way across the lawn where you could be seen?
Why not just pull up to the gate?

::crime_scene:fell_from_where

From the cliff across the street. Remember that?
Neither Cordelia nor I considered it because it's too far away from here.
A body that goes over a cliff is going to land at the bottom of the cliff, not a hundred yards away from it.
[[crime_scene:think_about_it]]


::crime_scene:fell_makes_no_sense
No, it does.
Remember, I told you there's a cliff face across the street. 
Neither Cordelia nor I considered it because it's too far away from here.
A body that goes over a cliff is going to land at the bottom of the cliff, not a hundred yards away from it.
[[crime_scene:think_about_it]]

::crime_scene:fell_possible
It's not just <i>possible</i>. I think it makes sense of a lot of things.
I can't explain why the killer dumped the body in the pool instead of the river, but that's a question for another time.
[[crime_scene:realize_what_this_means]]

::crime_scene:fell_why_pool
Yeah, I have no idea about that.
Maybe they thought they chlorine would get rid of fingerprints?
Who knows why bad guys do some of the dumb stuff they do.
[[crime_scene:realize_what_this_means]]

::crime_scene:think_about_it
Think about it.
The killer shoves Leder over the top of the cliff, and Leder lands in the middle of the road.
But that's too exposed for the killer's taste. He wants wants the body to go unnoticed for as long as possible.
So he comes down here, drags Leder's body across the street -- leaving the blood spatter -- and dumps him in the pool.

[[I guess it's possible.|crime_scene:fell_possible]] | [[Why the pool?^Why the pool instead of the river, like you said?|crime_scene:fell_why_pool]]

There's another scene. Mabye even the scene where Leder was murdered.
And it's directly above us.
Oh, jeez.
I'm such an idiot. How could I not have remembered?
You know what's directly above me?
[[Nope.|crime_scene:mt_bonnell]] | [[Yes!|crime_scene:yes_whats_above]]

::crime_scene:mt_bonnell
Mt. Bonnell!
It's a little park at the top of the cliff directly above us.
I haven't been there since I was a kid, but if I remember correctly, it's <i>directly</i> above me.
That's where I need to go.
Hang on. It should just take a few minutes to drive there.

Oh, yeah? What is it, o Geographic One?
[[Mount Bonnell|crime_scene:mt_bonnell]] | [[El Capitan|crime_scene:el_capitan]]

::crime_scene:arrive_mt_bonnell
I'm here now at the entrance to the park at Mount Bonnell.
There's a gravel parking area, and then a bunch of steps that lead up the side of the mountain.
The area here is thick with ash juniper trees, live oaks, and scrub brush.
Going up the steps now. There are exactly a hundred of them, if I recall correctly. 
Mount Bonnell has a dark history, as it happens.
Its first mention in history is when a white man killed a Tonkawa Indian he happened upon up here.
A few years later, some Tonkawa hid up here after kidnapping and killing a white settler, so tit-for-tat, I guess.
Legend has it that the place was once called "Antoinette's Leap" after a girl who leapt to hear death to escape some Indians.
As a Latino with probably equal parts white and Indian blood, who am I to take sides?
Hard to type and walk up steps. I'll be back with you in a minute.
<<delay 45s>>Rob is busy<<enddelay>>
Something just occurred to me while I was walking up here.
Leder's boss told me that Leder had a meeting with a potential buyer for the crystals yesterday morning.
What if <i>this</i> is where the meeting took place?
Something to consider. Still about 20 more steps to go.
<<delay 35s>>
I'm at the top. A little more out of breath than I'd like to admit.
Wow.
[[What do you see?|crime_scene:mt_what_see]] | [[Any evidence of a murder?|crime_scene:mt_murder]]


::crime_scene:el_capitan
Are you crazy? El Capitan is like 500 miles west of here, out by El Paso.
I guess I'm getting you a map of Texas for your birthday.
The correct answer is:
[[crime_scene:mt_bonnell]]

::crime_scene:mt_what_see
The view is unbelievable. Google "view from mount bonnell" if you don't believe me.
If you turn to the right, you can see all the way up the river to the Pennybacker bridge.
If you turn to the left, you can see downtown Austin spread out at your feet.
Across the river are some zillion-dollar homes nestled among the trees at the water's edge.
And if you look down, you can see 3902 Water's Edge and a little speck in a black windbreaker that must be Cordelia.
Anyone who fell -- or who was thrown -- from here, would have a very unpleasant journey.
It's not a clean drop. You'd tumble down over terraces of sharp rocks and gnarled trees that cling to the face.
And depending on how you fell, you'd either end up tangled up in the underbrush, never to be seen again...
... you'd land across the street from where Leder was found, in a strip of grass that's in full view of the road.
I'm guessing our killer was hoping for the former, but got the latter.
What should I do first up here?
There's nobody up here right now; the place is deserted.
I can feel this as a murder scene.
I can imagine the different ways it can happen. I just have to narrow it down.
I can start by looking around over by the cliff edge, or by the stone observation deck.
[[Look by the dropoff.|crime_scene:search_edge]] | [[Look by the observation deck.|crime_scene:search_deck]]






::crime_scene:mt_murder
I doubt there's going to be like a bloody baseball bat just lying on a bench up here.
I'll have to look at little more closely.
I'm just gawking at the view right now.
[[crime_scene:mt_what_see]]

::crime_scene:search_edge
There's a railing made of braided metal wire that's looped through pyramid-shaped stone posts. I'm stepping over it.
Very carefully.
I'm looking for signs of a scuffle here. Signs that someone went over the edge.
And I see it.
There are tufts of grass directly on the edge of the overhang here.
Kneeling down, I can see that something (or someone) has crushed some of them very recently.
From this position I can see all the way down to the road below, something like three hundred feet down.
Has anyone ever stood at the edge of something like this and <i>not</i> wondered what would happen if...
[[Are you thinking of killing yourself?|crime_scene:edge_think_killing]] | [[How does it make you feel?|crime_scene:edge_make_feel]]

::crime_scene:search_deck
The deck is the centerpiece of the tiny park. It's an oblong structure made of stone, surrounding a sad little garden.
The whole deal is made of casually mortared limestone, and covered by a line of pergolas.
It looks like the kind of thing where you might agree to meet someone, I'm thinking.
Wait -- pergolas are those things where it's like someone meant to put up a roof and then just gave up after framing it, right?
[[Yes, that's a pergola.|crime_scene:pergola_yes]] | [[No, that isn't a pergola.|crime_scene:pergola_no]]

::crime_scene:edge_think_killing
No. Never.
When I was a teenager, I thought about it a few times.
My dad had a gun and I knew where he kept it. I could have gone in there and gotten it easy.
But I never even could get through it in my head.
Just thinking about what it would do to my mamã¡ and my sisters was enough to stop me.
Instead I dream of just... <i>leaving</i>, you know?
Packing a bag, getting in my car, and driving until I run out of gas.
Wherever I end up, I would stay there. Get a job tending bar or making artisnal falafel, whatever.
That's the closest I ever come to wanting to kill myself.
[[Everyone feels like that sometimes.|crime_scene:edge_everyone_feels]] | [[Glad to hear it.|crime_scene:edge_glad_to_hear_it]]

Something most people don't get about cops is that when they pull you over they don't know much about you.
You might be a solid citizen: a nun or a kindergarten teacher.
On the other hand, you could be a gangbanger or a car thief, which makes you dangerous.
Or you could be any of the above but tweaked on meth, and then you're even more dangerous.
A cop never knows what he's getting into, even with the simplest traffic stop.
So be nice to the cop who pulls you over. He doesn't hate you.
He just wants to go home at the end of his shift.

::intro:start_tell_about_sarah
<<set $discussed_sarah = true>>
Where to begin with Sarah.
I guess it's fair to say that she saved my life.
When I was a teenager, we lived in a pretty bad part of Austin. 
There were a lot of tough kids at my high school. Like gangsta-lite, you know?
They sold weed, and they <i>had</i> a gun but it's not like they would ever shoot anyone.
They sure as hell didn't care about school or aything like that.
I was on my way to being one of them, but then I met Sarah.
She was in my Geometry class -- math was the only subject I didn't suck at -- 
and this might sound melodramatic, but she <i>saw</i> something in me.
She just kind of barged into my life, told me to stop handing out with those losers and start studying instead.
And I was so enamored of her that I just did whatever she said.
The thought that someone like her, so smart and so beautiful, would care about a nobody like me...
...it was pretty amazing.
If someone like her saw something in <i>me</i>, then maybe I was worth something after all, you know?
I loved her instantly. I thought she only saw me as a friend, or a project.
Then one night while we were studying for a History test, I gathered up all my courage, and I leaned over, and I kissed her.
She just smiled and said, "Took you long enough, dummy."
And we were pretty much together from then on.
[[What happened next?|intro:what_happened_sarah]] | [[How did she become your "ex" girlfriend?|intro:what_happened_sarah]]

::intro:what_happened_sarah
<<set $discussed_police = true>>
What happened was that we both graduated high school. She went to UT in Austin and I went to Community College there.
We stayed together. I tried really hard to be the person she needed me to be and a lot of the time I succeeded.
But after a while I started to think maybe I was just putting on an act for her, that it wasn't really me she loved.
But the person that I tried to be when I was with her. 
And maybe she wouldn't love the real me.
So after I got my associate's degree, I took the police exam for the APD, and I got in easy.
Sarah didn't like it -- she said I could do so much more with my life.
I said, "What's wrong with being a cop?" I got all defensive.
We went back and forth.
I became a cop. She didn't care for it. I think mainly she was nervous that I was going to get shot or something.
Which is crazy because nobody has ever shot at me in ten years on the job or even come close.
Well, until yesterday.
But then I became a homicide detective. I was really proud. I wanted to do a good job.
She didn't like me being out all hours, spending so much time on the job.
She wanted me to be successful, and now that I was successful, it was pissing her off!
So I kind of shouted at her. A lot.
And she kind of left.
And she's called me a few times and I haven't called her back.
And I feel like crap about it.
But I don't know what to say.
[[You should call her.|intro:should_call_sarah]] | [[What happened yesterday?|intro:what_happened_yesterday]]

::intro:hi_rob
Hi.
I need help.
I don't know what to do.
I don't even know where to start.
[[What's going on?|intro:whats_going_on]] | [[It's okay. Take your time.|intro:hi_take_your_time]]

::intro:whats_going_on
That's hard to explain. 
It's pretty complicated.
[[I have plenty of time.|intro:plenty_of_time]] | [[How is it complicated? |intro:how_complicated]]


::intro:plenty_of_time
Okay. Give me a second.
<<delay 5s>>Rob is busy<<enddelay>>
I think I'm in trouble.
Something... insane happened to me.
Something that couldn't possibly have happened.
Nobody will believe me. I'm not sure if <i>I</i> believe me.

[[What kind of trouble are you in?|intro:what_kind_of_trouble]] | [[No Pressure.^No pressure. You don't have to tell me anything.|intro:no_pressure]]

::intro:what_kind_of_trouble
I may have killed someone.
In the line of duty, I mean. I'm a cop.
The problem is that I have no idea if I actually <i>did</i> kill someone.
Does that sound crazy?
I know it does. That's the problem in a nutshell.

[["Crazy" isn't a word we like to use.|intro:crazy_not_good_word]] | [[What happened?|intro:what_did_you_see]]

::intro:crazy_not_good_word
Okay, fair enough.
Let's get technical. I'm afraid I might be psychotic.
Like the homeless guys I used to deal with when I was on patrol.
[[You experienced something disturbing.|intro:saw_disturbing]] | [[On patrol?|intro:on_patrol]]

::intro:saw_disturbing
That's a little bit of an understatement. 
It's more like I experienced something that totally undermined my assumptions about what's real and what isn't.
Assuming that I saw it, of course.
See the problem?
Let me ask you: do you believe in magic?
[[No, I don't|intro:believe_magic_no]] | [[I'm open to the idea|intro:believe_magic_yes]]

::intro:believe_magic_no
No, me either. 
Until yesterday I would have said that "magic" was just an uninspired Coldplay song.
(Or a really awesome Cars song, depending on how old you are.)
But...
I saw it so clearly -- the flames leaping toward me, reflected in her eyes. I could feel the heat of it.
I know what I saw was real, and that's what terrifies me.
[[Why does that terrify you?|intro:why_terrify]] | [[What was real?|intro:what_real]]

::intro:why_terrify
I'm terrified because only psychotic people <i>know</i> that the crazy things they see are real.
You see what I mean?
A healthy person sees something insane and they dismiss it as a trick of the light, or a figment of their imagination.
It takes a genuine crazy person to <i>know</i> that the crazy things they see are <i>real</i>.
Maybe at any other time I could shake it off. 
In my job I've seen all kinds of wackadoo stuff. I thought nothing could surprise me.
But now... I just <i>don't know anymore</i>.
The problem is, things have been bad with me for a while. Really bad.
I don't know if I'm coming or going.
[[Tell me about that.|intro:talk_bad_for_awhile]] | [[You don't sound psychotic.|intro:not_sound_psychotic]]

::intro:talk_bad_for_awhile
I guess I've always felt... off.
As long as I can remember, I've felt empty inside. Hollow.
There's this... bleakness that kind of follows me everywhere I go. I can't shake it.
It's like this thing that lives in my head and presses down on me and makes everything seem terrible.
And lately it's gotten a lot worse.
I don't know if it's being a cop and seeing all the horrible things I've seen, or if it's just brain chemicals.
But some days it's all I can do to just get out of bed. I just lie there and think, "Why bother?"
And when I do get up and force myself to go to work, I can hardly think. It's like static in my brain.
I'm depressed, okay? There it is. I'm depressed.
I guess I always have been. And over the past year it's gotten worse.
And with the job I have, I can't afford to be depressed. It's <i>literally</i> life or death.
But I can't talk to anyone in the department about this.
[[Why not?|intro:why_not_talk_cops]] | [[How do you usually handle those feelings?|intro:how_usually_handle]]





::intro:why_not_talk_cops
There's no way the other detectives or my superious would believe me.
I can't put what I saw into a report.
But I sure as hell can't ignore it.
So I'm stuck.
[[This must be really hard for you.|intro:stuck_hard]] | [[What happened?|intro:tell_what_happened]]


::intro:car_drive
I walk to my car, passing homeless guys and indie rockers, and I just drive.
I take Sixth down past all the crappy bars and tourist spots...
...past the higher end bars and empty lots that used to be bookstores and restaurants...
...and which are all now being converted into trendy boutique crap.
I drive across Lady Bird Lake and looked at the city across the water, my city, feeling it pull away from me.
I weave my way down Bee Cave Road, through West Lake Hills, where the richest of the rich live.
And then once I hit Loop 360 I floor it, flying over the rolling hills west of the city.
I come to this scenic overlook I used to bring girls to when I was in high school.
"Hey, look how pretty Austin looks from here. Are you cold? Let me put my arm around you..."
Except Sarah, of course. Sarah wouldn't have fallen for that.
Then I park and try to think who I can talk to.
[[Who can you talk to?|intro:overlook_talk]] | [[Who's Sarah?|intro:ask_sarah]]

::intro:falafel
I mean, it's tempting. The falafel life.
But ultimately I don't think I could be happy <i>just</i> making falafel. 
I'd have to supplement it with something else. 
Like kebabs.
[[intro:car_drive]]


::intro:overlook_talk
I can't talk to my mom, because she's dead.
I can't talk to my dad because he's also dead, not that it makes much of a difference.
I can't talk to Father Arturo because he'd just tell me to pray.
I can't talk to other cops because they'll all think I'm crazy.
<<if ! $mention_sarah>>
I can't talk to Sarah because... well, that's a long story.
<<endif>>
I'm just sitting here at this scenic overlook feeling more alone than I ever have in my whole life.
And then I think about this poster that just got hung up in the lobby of police headquarters.
"Need someone to talk to? Download the HelpLine App today!"
And so I do. And not over wi-fi either, man. I'm burning <i>data</i> for this.
So it'd better be good. 
<i>You'd</i> better be good, <<print $player>>. Because you're all I've <i>got</i>.
[[I'm here for you.|intro:here_for_you]] | [[I'll do the best I can to help.|intro:best_i_can]]

::intro:ask_sarah
<<set $mention_sarah = true>>
Sarah is... she was my girlfriend. Let's just leave it at that for right now.
Suffice to say that she wasn't dumb enough to be fooled by anything I said or did in high school.
The point is...I can't talk to her now.
[[intro:overlook_talk]]

::intro:here_for_you
I really appreciate that. I do.
[[Will the punch get you in trouble?|intro:get_trouble]] | [[How do you feel now?|intro:how_feel_now]]

::intro:happy_listen
I guess that has to be good enough, doesn't it?
It's not like you can look at the evidence and see for yourself.
I'll try to explain it as best I can.
[[All you can do is your best.|intro:explain_best]] | [[Just stick to the facts.|intro:stick_facts]]

::intro:explain_best
So here's the facts:
I'm in the middle of an investigation. 
The victim is an attorney.
I'm at his house, with a warrant, waiting for CSS to show up.
(CSS is short for "Crime Scene Service," not "Cascading Style Sheets," nerds.)
I know there's nobody at the house -- or so I think -- so I let myself in.
But before I get a chance to really look around, I hear a noise.
I go to check it out.
Turns out there's someone in the victim's office, turning the place upside-down.
She's blonde, maybe late twenties -- hard to tell, exactly. What's certain is that she's furious.
I flash my shield, and in my best cop voice, I say, "Excuse me, ma'am. I'm a police officer. Can I help you?"
She looks at me. Her eyes are a vivid green.
She stands up straight, cocks her head to the side.
She says, "Where are they?"
[[Who was she?|intro:who_was_she]] | [[Then what happened?|intro:she_threatens]]



::intro:she_threatens
And then she threatens me. Says if I don't tell her what I know, she'll <i>make</i> me tell.
And I explain again that I am a police officer and is she sure about that?
And she says that she can make me dance like a puppet on a string.
And I say that if she doesn't calm down we are going to have a serious problem.
And that's when she...
I don't know how to say it.
[[It's okay. Take your time.|intro:take_time_green]] | [[Keep going.|intro:keep_going_green]]

::intro:take_time_green
<<set $compassion ++>>
Thanks. I'm going to close my eyes for a few seconds. Take some deep cleansing breaths. Say a Hail Mary.
That kind of thing.
<<delay 10s>>Rob is busy<<enddelay>>
Okay. So, I tell her to calm down and repeat that I'm a police officer.
[[intro:keep_going_green]] 


::intro:what_do_to_green
I... shot her.
It was a reflex. 
I drew my weapon, and I put three in her chest, in a tight little cluster.
Sergeant Lopez back at the Academy would have been so proud.
First time I ever fired my weapon in the line of duty. After seven years.
I shot her.
[[You must have been freaked out.|intro:shot_freaked_out]] | [[Did you kill her?|intro:did_kill_green]]

::intro:shot_freaked_out
Oh, I'm pretty freaked out, all right.
First off, I've just shot someone.
Second, that someone was just spitting <i>fire</i> from <i>nozzles</i> in her <i>hands</i>.
And third -- and this is the part that I am having and even harder time with --
-- when she falls to the floor?
She vanishes.
As in "without a trace."
[[How is that possible?|intro:how_disappear_happen]] | [[Are you 100% sure?^Are you 100% sure that's what happened?|intro:you_sure_disappear]]

::intro:what_happened_after_shot
I pace back and forth for a second, trying to figure out what to do.
Then I realize that I've just fired my weapon in the home of a murder victim, and I can't explain why.
I know right away that I can't tell anyone about what happened.
[[Why can't you tell?|intro:why_not_tell_happened]] | [[What did you do?|intro:cover_up]]




::intro:hi_take_your_time
Okay.
I don't really know what I'm doing here, to be honest.
I don't know how much I should tell you.
It's complicated, and I know I'm not thinking straight.
[[In what way?^In what way is it complicated?|intro:how_complicated]] | [[You can talk about anything.^You can talk about whatever you want.|intro:talk_whatever]]

::intro:how_complicated
Unfortunately, there's no easy way to explain it.
I don't know if I should even be telling anyone this, but I have no choice.

[[No Pressure.^No pressure. You don't have to tell me anything.|intro:no_pressure]] | [[I won't judge.^You can tell me anything. I won't judge it.|intro:no_judge]]

::intro:talk_whatever
Yeah, but there's only this one thing that I <i>need</i> to talk about.
And I really do <i>need</i> to talk about it.
I just don't know if telling you is going to do any good.
Or if I should be telling you anything at all.
Dammit.
[[No Pressure.^No pressure. You don't have to tell me anything.|intro:no_pressure]] | [[I won't judge.^You can tell me anything. I won't judge it.|intro:no_judge]]


::intro:no_pressure
I appreciate that. I do. But there <i>is</i> pressure. A lot of it.
I need to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do now.
I think I may have made a huge mistake.
And I guess the truth is that I just don't trust myself to figure it out on my own.
[[What kind of mistake?|intro:what_kind_of_trouble]] | [[Why don't you trust yourself|intro:why_no_trust]]

::intro:no_judge
I appreciate that. I do. But I'm judging the hell out of myself right now.
I think I might have made a huge mistake.
I need to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do now.
And I guess the truth is that I just don't trust myself to figure it out on my own.
[[What huge mistake?|intro:what_kind_of_trouble]] | [[Why don't you trust yourself|intro:why_no_trust]]

::intro:what_did_you_see
What happened? How do I even say it?
If I say I saw the devil, does that make me crazy?
What if f I say I saw a "heretofore unknown phenomenon"?
What if I say I saw "magic"? How about that?
Which of those things makes me seem the least crazy?
[[Let's avoid using words like "crazy".|intro:crazy_not_good_word]] | [[What do you think?|intro:what_think_crazy]]

::intro:why_no_trust
Because what I saw <i>couldn't</i> have happened.
Like, just 100% impossible.
But it happened right in front of me.
So I'm forced to accept that I absolutely experienced something I know to be impossible.
[[intro:what_kind_of_trouble]]

::intro:on_patrol
Oh, yeah. I'm a detective now. A homicide detective.
My days as a uni are finally behind me, thank God.
That's part of why this is so hard to talk about. It's cop stuff.
[[Why does being a detective make it hard to talk?|intro:why_cop_hard]] | [[What's a "uni"?|intro:define_uni]]

::intro:what_think_crazy
What do <i>I</i> think?
I don't even know <i>what</i> to think. Isn't that what you're supposed to tell me?
[[Not exactly.|intro:not_here_to_tell]] | [[I sounds like what you saw was disturbing.|intro:saw_disturbing]]

::intro:not_here_to_tell
Right, right. You're supposed to be a good listener and all that.
I learned about "reflectiving listening" when I was on patrol.
Repeat back what you hear the person say so they know you're listening.
Ask them to talk more about their feelings.
Never offer any opinions of your own because that'd be "judging."
[[That's pretty much it, yeah.|intro:listener_yes]] | [[On patrol?|intro:on_patrol]]

::intro:listener_yes
Okay. Fair enough.
Just answer me this one question: do you believe in magic?
[[No, not really.|intro:believe_magic_no]] | [[I'm not opposed to it.|intro:believe_magic_yes]]

::intro:define_uni
Sorry. "Uni" is short for "uniformed patrol officer."
Cop jargon.
[[intro:why_cop_hard]]

::intro:believe_magic_yes
Why? What makes you think that magic could possibly be real?
You understand I'm not asking if Criss Angel is real, right? 
We both know all too well that he is, sadly.
//Criss Angel is a TV magician who is very "Rock 'n' Roll" and considered fairly annoying and cheesy.
I'm talking about real magic. Spooky supernatural "magic" magic.
[[Because I know Arika.^I knew someone named Arika. She was a real magic user.|intro:knew_arika]] | [[I have my reasons.^I have my own reasons for believing. But I believe.|intro:just_believe]]

::intro:why_cop_hard
This all happened while I was on the clock, doing official cop stuff.
It's part of an active investigation, and I don't want to screw that up.
I'm not supposed to discuss cases with anyone besides other cops.
But I think I'm going to anyway.
I don't think I have a choice.
Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in magic?
[[No, not really.|intro:believe_magic_no]] | [[I'm not opposed to it.|intro:believe_magic_yes]]

::intro:not_personal
Thanks. That's very big of you.
Honestly, though. I am terrified.
[[intro:why_terrify]]

::intro:what_real
I'll tell you. Just... give me a minute.
All kidding aside, I really am genuinely terrified right now.
[[intro:why_terrify]]

::intro:not_sound_psychotic
Well, hey! That's something!
A stranger on the Internet told me I don't sound psychotic!
Sorry. I'm trying to rein in my usual sarcasm and cynicism, but I don't think it's working.
[[Sarcasm won't help.|intro:no_snark]] | [[I can take it.|intro:snark_away]]

::intro:snark_away
That's a relief. Because otherwise I was going to go crazy trying not to be a wiseass.
I said "crazy" again. Sorry. 
[[Just don't let it happen again.|intro:no_crazy_again]] | [[You said things have been going bad for a while?|intro:talk_bad_for_awhile]]

::intro:no_crazy_again
Okay... but if it turns out I actually <i>am</i> crazy, I'm going to use that word all I want.
And nobody will be able to stop me, because I'll be crazy.
Here's the thing:
[[intro:talk_bad_for_awhile]]

::intro:how_usually_handle
I don't know. I guess I don't usually "handle" them. I just smoosh them down until they stop bugging me.
That's the cop way, and that's how we do things in my family.
When I was a teenager, my dad would take me aside and say, "Roberto, you're too angry. You need to shape up and be a man."
Of course, he said it in Spanish. The only English words my dad ever learned were "Quarter Pounder" and "Miller Lite".
[[What do you wish he'd said?|intro:dad_talk]] | [[That sucks.|intro:dad_finish]]

::intro:knew_arika
You actually <i>know</i> someone who does magic. Okay. Cool.
I will... file that away.
[[intro:out_of_mind_magic]]

::intro:just_believe
Hey, you know what? Different strokes for different folks, I always say.
I mean, I don't <i>say</i> it. It sounds kind of dirty, to be honest.
But, okay, so you believe in magic.
[[intro:out_of_mind_magic]]

::intro:out_of_mind_magic
You know, yesterday I would have said that you were out of your mind.
But I know what I saw and that's what terrifies me.
[[I don't take it personally.|intro:not_personal]] | [[What terrifies you?|intro:why_terrify]]

::intro:no_snark
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen. Sorry.
I guess you haven't met a lot of cops.
One time I arrested a guy who'd clubbed his next door neighbor to death over a <i>Jeopardy</i> answer.
It's hard not to get a little dark when you have my job.
[[Fair enough.^Fair enough. Snark away, then.|intro:snark_away]] | [[Was it final Jeopardy?|intro:final_jeopardy]]


::intro:final_jeopardy
I see what you're doing there, fighting snark with snark.
And to answer your question, yes, it was final jeopardy. 
The victim answered out loud before the perp had a chance to guess.
When I asked him why that made him commit murder, his face went dark and he said...
..."It wasn't the first time he'd done it."
Okay, so maybe I compensate with a little dark humor, but you can see why.
Usually that's enough to get me by, but lately things have been pretty bad.
And now... I feel too unmoored to know what I'm doing.
[[What's been bad?|intro:talk_bad_for_awhile]] | [[Unmoored how?|intro:talk_bad_for_awhile]]

[[I'm happy to listen.^I'm happy to listen and help you figure out what you think.|intro:happy_listen]] | [[I can't decide that.^I don't think I can decide that for you.|intro:cant_decide_for_you]]

[[I can only promise to listen.|intro:happy_listen]] | [[Tell me and we'll see.|intro:explain_best]]

::intro:who_was_she
No idea. I'd never seen her before. All I remember is blonde hair and those eyes.
Green.
Like, <i>too</i> green. At first I thought she was wearing colored contacts, but now I'm not sure.
[[intro:she_threatens]]

::intro:keep_going_green
That's when she... changes.
She kind of starts to turn red, like she's really angry, right?
Then she holds up her hands, pointing them at me with the fingertips all together.
And I watched her fingers merge together and become like a hole or something.
Two holes, actually, one at the end of each hand, like nozzles.
And then there's this smell, like methane, and she hisses.
"Where are they?. Where are they? Tell me or burn!"
And then -- and I swear this happened -- 
-- there's a little "whoosh", like when your gas grill lights.
And flames start pouring from her hands, or rather the nozzles that her hands have become.
And she's <i>shrieking</i> like this is causing her pain, and her skin is red and shining, and the flames are reflected in her eyes.
And she's walking toward me, shouting, "Tell me!"
And that's when I... oh, man. 
[[What did you do?|intro:what_do_to_green]] | [[Tell her what?^What did she want you to tell her?|intro:green_okay]]

::intro:green_okay
I'm not entirely sure. She wanted to know where something was, but she didn't say what.
[[intro:what_do_to_green]]

::intro:did_kill_green
Well, that's the part that's really hard to know, as it turns out.
See, as soon as I shoot her, she goes down hard, still screaming.
But instead of just falling to the floor, she falls <i>through</i> the floor.
She disappears. The flames disappear. 
It's like she was never there.
[[How could that have happened?|intro:how_disappear_happen]] | [[Are you sure?^ Are you completely sure that's what happened?|intro:you_sure_disappear]]


::intro:how_disappear_happen
That's the million dollar question, isn't it? How?
How does a woman with three bullets in her chest fall backward into a Persian rug in broad daylight and disappear?
The answer is I have no idea, but I'm sure as hell going to find out.
[[How did you feel when it happened?|intro:how_feel_happened]] | [[What happened next?|intro:what_next_disappear]]

::intro:you_sure_disappear
No! I'm <i>not</i> entirely sure!
That's what I've been trying to tell you!
I know what I saw, okay? There was nothing vague or illusion-like about it.
It wasn't like she vanished into the shadows.
It was broad daylight. She was standing in the middle of a room, on a Persian rug.
And then she just fell <i>into</i> the rug.
And yes, I searched for convenient trapdoors, if that's your next question.
Nothing underneath but concrete slab.
[[Sorry.|intro:sorry_doubt]] | [[What did you do next?|intro:what_next_disappear]]

::intro:sorry_doubt
No, no. You're the one who's talking sense. I know I sound bonkers.
That's the whole point of why I need you.
So don't give me a hard time about it.
Anyway. Moving on.
[[intro:what_next_disappear]]

::intro:what_next_disappear
So I'm standing there. Alone.
My ears are still ringing from the shots.
There are wisps of smoke in the air from the barrel of my Glock.
There's a pungent tang of gunpowder in the air.
There are my three spent casings on the floor, and my weapon is warm to the touch.
But the woman I shot, and the three rounds I put into her?
Just... gone.
[[Then what happened?|intro:what_happened_after_shot]] | [[How did you feel then?|intro:how_feel_disappear]]

::intro:how_feel_happened
This might be hard for you to understand.
You might think I'd feel confused, or scared, but neither of those feelings even registered.
Maybe this is just post-hoc revision, but here's how it feels in my memory --
I was angry. 
Sometimes anger is all I can feel.
I'm like a Metallica song with a badge.
I'm probably not coming off too great here.
[[I know how you feel.|intro:understand_angry]] | [[You come off as human.|intro:come_off_human]]

::intro:understand_angry
You do? I'm genuinely sorry to hear that.
So here's what happens next.
[[intro:what_next_disappear]]

::intro:come_off_human
That's me -- Rob Esposito, "coming off as human" since 1986.
Sorry -- I know what you meant. I'm just giving you crap.
That means I like you. It's a cop thing.
Moving on.
[[intro:what_next_disappear]]

::intro:how_feel_disappear
Then I feel like my head is going to explode.
I keep looking at the floor, kicking the rug.
I'm shouting, "Where the hell are you?"
Nothing.
[[intro:what_happened_after_shot]]

::intro:get_trouble
Well, yeah. Even at the tough-guy cop shop, they still frown on punching holes in things.
I <i>might</i> could get suspended. But probably not.
See, if there's one thing a defense attorney would <i>love</i> to see during discovery...
...it's that the lead detective on an investigation was suspended for losing his mind.
So they probably won't do that unless I end up raving on the streets or something, wearing a pie tin as a beanie.
[[What will you do now?|intro:what_do_now]] | [[Can you take some time off?|intro:take_time_off]]

::intro:how_feel_now
I don't know.
It's like I can feel angry, or I can feel hollow. But nothing else.
All things considered, I'll take angry. 
Anger gives me momentum. I can move forward when I'm angry.
What I can't seem to do is think straight, or trust my own judgment.
And that's a big problem.
[[What will you do now?|intro:what_do_now]] | [[Can you take time off?|intro:take_time_off]]

::intro:what_do_now
What I'm going to do now is my job.
Nobody knows about the woman I shot.
And that means that Dietz would be walking into something he don't understand the first thing about.
And he's not the best detective in the world to begin with, if we're being honest.
That's the noble reason, but maybe not the biggest one.
The biggest one is that I need to find out what the hell happened in that house.
I need to find that woman. And I will.
If it's the last thing I do.
[[intro:have_an_idea]]

::intro:take_time_off
I guess I could. I'm one of those people who stores up vacation hours like they appreciate in value.
But I'm not going to. I'm going to keep working this case.
I kind of have to. You get that, right?
[[Why do you have to?|intro:why_have_to]] | [[I guess so.|intro:what_do_now]]

::intro:why_have_to
Because if I take time off, Dietz will be alone this case.
He doesn't know what actually happened.
Maybe I <i>am</i> hallucinating, but I don't believe it.
That means my partner is walking into something he doesn't understand the first thing about.
And Dietz is <i>not</i> the best detective in the world, to be honest.
That's the noble reason, but maybe not the biggest one.
The biggest one is that I need to find out what the hell happened in that house.
I need to find that woman. And I will.
If it's the last thing I do.
[[intro:have_an_idea]]

::intro:have_an_idea
I need to think. I'll check back with you in a few minutes, okay?
<<delay 4m>>Rob is busy<<enddelay>>
Okay. I'm going to ask you something.
I want you to think really hard about it, because what I'm asking you is deadly serious.
Will you help me work this case?
[[What do you mean?^What do you mean, "work this case"?|intro:what_mean_work_case]] | [[That's not a good idea.^I'm not sure what you mean, but it sounds like a bad idea.|intro:help_bad_idea]]

::intro:what_mean_work_case
What I mean is that I need a partner.
Not an actual partner -- I already have one.
Though Dietz is a lot more interested in the yoga studio he owns with his wife than he is in the job.
I need is someone to help me think, because I can barely think right now.
I need someone to make sure I'm making the right calls, because my head is full of static.
I need someone to be my better judgment, because I don't trust mine right now.
I know it sounds--less than sane--but it actually makes sense.
You're a great listener. You're observant, and you're objective.
It might not be the most entirely legal setup in the world, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
There's no one else I can talk to. THere's no one else I can turn to.
I need you. Will you help me?
[[Yes.^Yes. I'll help you.|intro:yes_help]] | [[Sounds like a bad idea.^Now that you've explained it, it sounds like a bad idea.|intro:help_bad_idea]]

::intro:yes_help
Okay, wow. That's... that's great news.
I realize I'm asking a lot here. I promise that I won't let any of this blow back on you.
I just need you to promise me that you won't tell anyone else about the things I'm going to tell you.
Someone died, and I need you to respect their privacy.
Will you promise to me that you won't ever tell another soul any of the things I'm going to tell you?
[[I promise|intro:promise_yes]] | [[Sorry, I can't promise that.|intro:promise_no]]

::intro:help_bad_idea
Look, I know it's not the most orthodox arrangement.
But this is a highly unorthodox situation. 
Under normal circumstances, I'd never ask a stranger to help me with an investigation.
Where I'm at, though, is so far from normal circumstances that you can't even get there from here.
I need is someone to help me think, because I can barely think right now.
I need someone to make sure I'm making the right calls, because my head is full of static.
I need someone to be my better judgment, because I don't trust mine right now.
I know it sounds -- less than sane -- but it actually makes sense.
You're a great listener. You're observant, and you're objective.
All I'm asking is for you to try.
A real person died, <<print $player>>. A person with a life. With a family.
Those people suffering right now, much worse than I am.
I'm giving you a chance to help them, too.
[[Okay, I guess I can try.|intro:yes_help]] | [[No. I'm sorry.|intro:no_help]]

::intro:no_help
Okay. I get it. I knew I sounded crazy.
Maybe I am.
Yeah, I said crazy. What are you gonna do about it.
Have a nice life, <<print $player>>. 
I'll work it out on my own.
<<set $end_state = "no_help">>
[[main:end]]

::intro:promise_yes
Great. Now then.
If we're going to work together, I'm going to have to get you up to speed.
I'm going to drive home now. I can pull up the case file on my laptop there and give you the details.
I live in East Austin, so it'll take me about twenty minutes.
I'll check in when I get there.
And just so I don't forget...
Thank you.
<<delay 22m>>Rob is busy<<enddelay>>
Okay. I'm home. Give me just a minute to fire up the computer.
Man, it's amazing how much East Austin has changed since I was a kid.
When I was little, it was nothing but Latinos and African Americans --
-- white people only came over here to get barbecue and Mexican food.
Now it's the gringos making the barbecue and Mexican food, and the brown people have to live someplace else.
I'm supposed to hate gentrification, because I'm Latino and I grew up here.
And I do... mostly. 
I mean, I can barely afford the property taxes on this house anymore.
But secretly I'm really stoked about the quality of the beer selection at the corner stores.
You promised not to talk about any of this.
[[I promised not to talk about the case.|intro:promised_not_case]] | [[Your secret is safe with me.|intro:secret_safe]]

::intro:promise_no
Seriously?
You're going to offer to help me, but you're not going to promise to keep quiet about it?
What are you gonna do, post our conversation on your law-enforcement Tumblr page?
[[Sorry. Of course I'll promise.|intro:promise_yes_instead]] | [[I can't make a promise like that.|intro:promise_no_way]]

::intro:promise_yes_instead
Okay. Don't mess with me like that, <<print $player>>.
Seriously.
[[intro:promise_yes]]

::intro:promise_no_way
Okay, if that's how you want to play it.
Have a great life, <<print $player>>.
Wish me luck.
<<set $end_state = "no_promise">>
[[main:end]]

::intro:question_like_this
Yes, exactly like that. You're very clever. I can see I picked the right person to team up with.
If this counseling thing doesn't work out, you have a bright future in improv comedy.
[[intro:beginning_2]]

::intro:question_ok
Well done.
[[intro:beginning_2]]

::intro:the_beginning
Okay, I have the file up now. Let's go over it.
While I'm talking, feel free to interrupt me to ask questions, or just say "okay" if you get it.
[[Like this?|intro:question_like_this]] | [[Okay.|intro:question_ok]]

::intro:promised_not_case
Huh. I guess that's true. Still.
[[intro:the_beginning]]

::intro:secret_safe
Thanks. You're a credit to your profession.
[[intro:the_beginning]]

::intro:beginning_2
Now then.
I'm just going to run down the chronology of the case file.
The chronology contains every event recorded in the case to date.
It starts yesterday at 6:10 a.m., when 911 receives a confused call from a citizen.
The address is out by Lake Austin -- a very nice part of town, as it happens.
She's calling to report a drowned man in the swimming pool across the street.
Paramedics show up at 6:19, and they do the irritating thing that paramedics always do in this situation --
-- which is that they attempt to revive the clearly very dead man, whom we can now refer to as our victim.
[[Why would they do that?|intro:why_paramedics_revive]] | [[Okay.|intro:cops_show_up]]


::intro:why_paramedics_revive
Not sure. It can't <i>just</i> be to make my job harder, but you never know.
They claim it's something to do with "exhausting all lifesaving measures."
I think they just really like their jobs.
I mean, why else would they do such difficult, dangerous work for so little money?
It's hard to be mad at paramedics.
Especially when firefighters are so much worse.
[[What's wrong with firefighters?|intro:firefighters]] | [[Okay.|intro:cops_show_up]]

::intro:cops_show_up
By the time the paramedics have fished the body out of the pool and attempted to resuscitate the victim...
...the entire scene is pretty much totally compromised.
The first officer to arrive on the scene, at 6:22 is someone named... Oscar Olivarez, who I never met before yesterday.
He seems like a fairly comptetent cop.
He secures the scene, calls the homicide division, and makes notes of everything he sees.
He does not touch the body, and he does not track useless footprints all around the edge of the pool.
If only Lieutenants and Captains were as reliable at crime scenes as Oscar Olivarez is.
[[Why is that stuff important?|intro:why_evidence_important]] | [[Okay.|intro:rob_gets_call]]



::intro:why_evidence_important
Oh, because by tromping around my crime scene, all these people are making evidence collection a nightmare.
You want footprints? You got a million of 'em. Good luck with that, crime lab tech!
You want hair, fibers, trash? You got it! Good luck with that, young criminalist!
I even saw a Lieutenant crush out a cigarette butt next to a body once.
That actually happened.
Thank God it wasn't my Lieutenant.
[[intro:rob_gets_call]]

::intro:rob_gets_call
Let's see here.
Oh, look. Here's where I first enter the story, at 6:28.
I work what they call a 9/17 shift, which means I work nine-hour days, nine out of ten weekdays.
I'm there every day at six or so. Which is nice because there's not so much traffic...
...but it almost totally negates the possibility of an active social life.
Sergeant Wheeler takes the call himself, checks the board, and sees that I'm up.
He tells me I've got a floater.
[[What's a floater?|intro:floater]] | [[Okay.|intro:gory]]

::intro:rob_goes_to_scene
According to the chronolgy, I'm logged at the crime scene 6:55 and I officially take control of it.
Dietz is teaching a Hatha Flow yoga class, which he does every now and again while he's on duty.
Did I mention he's not the best partner?
I commend patrol officer Olivarez for his handling of the scene and tell him to stick around.
The 911 caller's husband, a very alarmed rich white guy, has questions for me.
He's going back and forth between us and his wife and kids, who he keeps shooing back into the house.
I tell him that he needs to leave, which is something that I don't think he has heard a lot in his life.
He's about to lay into me but I give him the cop stare and he just kind of withers.
I wish I could say that I don't enjoy doing that to d-bags like him, but I do.
[[What's a cop stare?|intro:cop_stare]] | [[Okay.|intro:examine_house]]


::intro:dad_talk
I don't know. <i>Anything</i> supportive?
One time I got in a fight at school. I don't remember what about. But I hurt the other kid pretty bad.
My dad asked me what I was thinking, and I said something like:
"I wasn't <i>thinking</i> anything. I just feel angry all the time."
And he said, "A real man doesn't talk about feelings! Go see Father Arturo if you want to whine about feelings!"
So I went to see Father Arturo; he was old and slow and kind of distant. 
He listend to everything I said and just told me to ask Jesus for forgiveness.
I figured I was just whiny and I needed to man up, like my dad said.
So I never talked to anyone else about my feelings after that.
Until Sarah. But that's not important right now.

[[That sucks.|intro:dad_finish]] | [[You can talk about Sarah.|intro:can_talk_sarah]]

::intro:dad_finish
Yeah. It does.
Well, it did. My dad's dead now, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Anyway.
[[intro:why_not_talk_cops]]

::intro:can_talk_sarah
No, I'm sorry. I want to keep her out of this. I hope you can understand.
Anyway, back to the story.
[[intro:why_not_talk_cops]]

::intro:floater
Oh, sorry. That's the ever-so-sensitive cop slang for a drowning victime.
I'll warn you up front that cops aren't always the most PC people.
We typically don't like dealing with floaters.
A body that gets fished out of the water after it's been in for a while can be decidedly unpleasant to deal with. 
[[intro:gory]]

::intro:gory
We're about to get to the part where I see the body. 
If you like, I can leave out the more graphic elements of the story.
Sometimes police work involves a lot of gory details; that's just how it is.
But if that kind of stuff turns your stomach I can leave the grossest parts out.
What do you prefer?
[[I can handle it.|intro:can_handle_gore]] | [[I prefer things less gory, thanks.|intro:cant_handle_gore]]

::intro:can_handle_gore
<<set $gore = true>>
Okay, you asked for it. Just don't come crying to me if you yodel your groceries later.
[[intro:describe_scene]]

::intro:cant_handle_gore
<<set $gore = false>>
Okay, I'll try to keep the blood and guts to a minimum.
[[intro:describe_scene]]

::intro:cop_stare
The cop stare is a thing you learn pretty quick on the street.
It's kind of a steely-eyed (some might uncharitably say "dead-eyed") glare that lets people know you're serious.
That if you mess around with me there will be dire consequences.
My Field Training Officer called it "putting on The Show."
[[Why would you enjoy doing that?|intro:why_enjoy_stare]] | [[Okay.|intro:examine_house]]

::intro:examine_house
The first thing I do is take in the scene.
It's the backyard of a really nice home in a really nice part of town.
The kind of house they call a McMansion -- too big, too gaudy for Austin's laid-back tastes.
Austin being Austin, they actually passed an ordinance banning these things in some parts of town.
But this house clearly predates the ordinance because it looks a cross between a medieval castle and a Barbie dream home.
It's well-tended, but there doesn't appear to be anyone there.
No cars in the driveway, no answer to my knocking.
The lot must be worth a fortune, right up on the water of Lake Austin. 
It has a private boat dock, and a swimming pool just a few feet from the water.
Why you need a swimming pool when you have an entire lake right there is beyond me...
...but you know what Fitzgerald said about the very rich.
[[What did Fitzgerald say?|intro:what_fitzgerald]] | [[Gotcha.|intro:examine_body]]

::intro:why_enjoy_stare
Aw, man. I was hoping you wouldn't call me on that.
I don't know why. Maybe it's because for a lot of my life I felt kind of helpless.
It feels good to be in a position of authority.
I know that sounds like it's a power trip. 
Maybe for some cops it is, but I think for most of us it's a feeling that you can handle anything that comes your way.
It's a feeling of strength. Like you're somebody.
I don't know. Maybe that's just me. I can't speak for anyone else.
[[intro:examine_house]] 


::intro:what_fitzgerald
You had to call me on it. I admit it, I don't remember the line exactly. Something about how they're way different from you and me.
Google like "Fitzgerald very rich" and it'll probably be the top hit.
[[intro:examine_body]] 


::intro:examine_body
Next I take a look at the body, but there's not much to see there.
He's a young guy, Caucasian, good-looking before the beating he took, clearly in good health at the time of his death. 
He's dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt commemorating a law firm employee retreat.
This is a guy who worked out, ate dinosaur kale, and got weekly massages, I'm guessing.
For all the good it did him.
After being in the pool and having the EMTs work him over, trace evidence is going to be hard to collect.
<<if $gore>>
He's covered in cuts and scrapes, and looks to have numerous broken bones. 
There's a pretty serious break in one of his legs -- part of his left femur is sticking out at a forty-five degree angle.
There's post-mortem lividity in his face, arms, and legs, meaning he was face-down in the pool for a while after he died.
Hey, you said you didn't mind the gory stuff.
<<else>>
He's got cuts and scrapes all over his body, and at least one of his legs is broken.
Post-mortem lividity tells me he was face-down in the pool for a while after he died.
<<endif>>
So it's a safe bet he didn't just fall into the pool and drown.
Either he was beat up and fell into the pool, or he was killed and then someone dumped him there.
The medical examiner will be able to tell me.
[[What's post-mortem lividity?|intro:livor_mortis]] | [[Okay.|intro:check_pockets]]

::intro:check_pockets
I check his pocket and I find a money clip.
Inside there's... hang on... there's an inventory here someplace.
Okay.
Inside there's a key fob for a Lexus and a Texas driver's license.
The license identifies him as Jason Eric Leder, of 2212 Sunny Slope Drive.
With that address, he wasn't doing too bad for himself.
There aren't any other personal effects except for a standard gold band wedding ring.
Which means I've got a spouse to notify.
[[That must be a difficult thing to do.|intro:difficult_spouse]] | [[What did you do next?|intro:notify_wife]]


::intro:livor_mortis
<<if $gore>>
Oh, right. Post-mortem lividity, or <i>livor mortis</i> is the blood settling in the lowest part of the body after death.
It causes reddish purple marks on the skin.
We use it to help determine what position the body was in when the victim died.
It looks kind of like a big bruise.
<<else>>
You said you weren't into the gory details, so let's just say that it's a way you can tell what position someone was in when they died.
And leave it at that.
<<endif>>
[[intro:check_pockets]] 


::intro:difficult_spouse
It's not fun. Information a husband or wife that their spouse has died is about the most unpleasant task you can perform.
That said, I do my best to be as kind and supportive as I can.
Being there for people at the worst moments of their lives is a big part of what cops do.
In this case, however, notifying the spouse was where I first noticed something weird about the Leder investigation.
[[How so?|intro:notify_wife]] | [[What did you do next?|intro:notify_wife]]

::intro:notify_wife
I get Letty, the devision admin, on the phone. 
She does her computer magic and gives me the name of Leder's wife -- Mia Westerman -- along with cell and work numbers.
Normally the coroner notifies next of kin, but I want to talk to her beforehand.
People who have just learned their spouse is dead aren't really helpful, like they are on TV.
On cop shows, the recently bereaved spouse daubs her eyes with a tissue and answers the detectives' questions.
In real life, they mostly freak out, like you'd expect.
I call the cell and Mia Westerman picks up. I tell her who I am and ask if she could meet me at her home.
She asks if there was a break-in or something, and says I should speak to her husband because she's in Houston at a conference.
[[That's awkward.|intro:houston_awkward]] | [[What did you say to her?|intro:what_say_mia]]


::intro:think_mia_killed
It's way too early to say. I have way too many questions at this point.
If a married woman dies, you always look at the husband first.
If a married man dies, you look elsewhere first. It's just simple statistics.
Men are about nine times as likely to kill their wives as wives are to kill their husbands.
Sorry, bros.
Mia's response was strange, but not outside the realm of possibility.
[[intro:visit_leder_house]]

::intro:visit_leder_house
So at this point, since she's calm, I ask Mia if she knows who might have killed her husband, and she says no.
I tell her that I'm going to have to get a warrant to search her house. She doesn't seem to flinch at that.
In fact, she tells me there's a key under the ceramic frog by the door, and please don't break anything.
What she doesn't ask is how he died, which is interesting.
[[Why is that interesting?|intro:why_no_ask_interesting]] | [[Okay.|intro:next_calls]]

::intro:why_no_ask_interesting
When someone finds out that a loved one has died, the first thing they almost always ask is how it happened.
People want to know if their loved one suffered. They want to know what happened.
Inexperienced murderers often forget to ask, because they already know the answer.
[[intro:next_calls]]

::intro:next_calls
By this time, the Crime Scene folks have arrived at the scene. I point some stuff out to them, request a couple specific photos.
But these people are pros; they don't really need my assistance, and I have other things to do.
So I head back to the office to write up the warrant on the Leder home.
While I'm doing that, I call Leder's employer to let them know what's going on and see if I can get any information.
The boss, a guy named Sherwood, sounds genuinely shocked and horrified. Says he'll offer whatever assistance he can.
Then he asks what happened to the crystals.
And I say, "What crystals?"
He tells me that Leder was acting as a go-between to sell some very valuable and rare crystals.
And that Leder had a meeting about them yesterday morning, around six a.m. He doesn't know where the meeting was.
So that's interesting.
[[What kind of crystals?|intro:what_kind_crystals]] | [[Why is that interesting?|intro:why_crystals_interesting]]

::intro:tell_mia_come_home
Like I said, it's the coroner's job, so I haven't done a million of these notifications, but I've done a few.
Once I told a man that his wife was dead, and his only response was, "Good."
But he was a sociopath with a sheet a mile long and she'd been very publicly cheating on him.
Mia Westerman, on the other hand, is the sales manager for an organic bagged salad company.
I tell her that she needed to come home immediately and she says she'll be on the next plane.
That plane lands in a couple of hours -- I'm <i>really</i> looking forward to talking to her.
[[Do you think she killed him?|intro:think_mia_killed]] | [[What happened next?|intro:visit_leder_house]]

::intro:what_kind_crystals
No clue. Sherwood said I should talk to the owner of the crystals, said she'd be eager to help if they're missing.
Her name is Mary Jo Irving.
Now at least I have one piece of the puzzle in place.
When someone is murdered while in them midst of selling something rare and valuable...
... it doesn't take a rocket scientist to guess at a potential motive for the crime.
But that remains to be seen.
[[intro:end_of_exposition]]

::intro:why_crystals_interesting
Leder was meeting someone about selling some rare, valuable crystals at the time he was murdered.
There aren't many coincidences in my line of work.
It's a good guess that these crystals have something to do with it.
I need to talk to the woman who's selling them to find out more about them, and who might have wanted them.
[[intro:end_of_exposition]]

::intro:end_of_exposition
I get off the phone with Leder's boss at 8:58. 
I send off my warrant to search Leder's house to the judge, and a little while later, it's signed.
So I head on over to the Leder house.
And that's when I meet the green-eyed woman:
I let myself in using the key under the frog. 
I hear a sound from the office.
The woman is there -- the green-eyed woman.
She -- oh my God!
[[What is it?|intro:what_is_it_where_are_they]] | [[Are you okay?|intro:okay_where_are_they]]

::intro:what_is_it_where_are_they
It just hit me -- what she said was, "Where are they?"
I didn't know what she meant at the time, but now it seems fairly obvious:
<i>she was talking about the crystals</i>.
[[intro:now_you_know_everything]]

::intro:okay_where_are_they
Yeah, sorry. It wasn't "Oh my God" as in "I'm in trouble." It was "Oh my God" as in "I just realized something."
What the green-eyed woman said was, "Where are they?"
Now I realize what she was talking about.
She was looking for those crystals.
[[intro:now_you_know_everything]]

::intro:now_you_know_everything
You know what happened after that. She came at me. I shot her.
She... vanished.
I puked and punched a wall.
I considered a new career in falafel.
I drove out here to the scenic overpass. I don't know how long I sat here before downloading this app.
But I'm glad I did.
I feel a little better just telling you all of this.
And now you know everything I know.
Are you ready to start helping me?
[[Why do you need help?|intro:why_need_help]] | [[You bet.|intro:you_bet_help]]


::intro:why_need_help
I'm not sure I can trust my own judgment. 
Sometimes lately I can barely complete a thought on my own.
There's static in my brain and a weight on my chest.
I can't think; sometimes it feels like I can barely breathe.
And that was before a woman shot flames from her hands and then vanished when I shot her.
I <i>need</i> you.
So I'm really glad you're here.
[[No problem.|intro:here_no_problem]] | [[Okay. What do we do first?|intro:end]]

::intro:you_bet_help
Thanks. I really appreciate it.
Sometimes lately I can barely complete a thought on my own.
There's static in my brain and a weight on my chest.
I can't think; sometimes it feels like I can barely breathe.
And that was before all the crazy with the green-eyed woman.
I'm really glad you're here.
[[intro:end]]

::intro:here_no_problem
I'd like to tell you it's going to be easy. But I don't think it will.
I'm pretty sure you'll be safe, but if I feel like that's going to change, I'll delete this app as fast as I can.
I'll throw my phone into the Colorado river before I'll let anything happen to you, I promise.
[[intro:end]]


::intro:end
Now then. The first thing I need your help with is pretty straightforward.
I need to know where to go first.
[[main:choice_1]]

::intro:describe_scene
So let's talk about the scene for a second.
The location, like I said, is a house by Lake Austin, which is really just a wide spot in the Colorado River.
It's an odd location, a narrow strip of land bordered by the river on the west.
It's about a hundred yards wide or so -- wide enough for the street, and big homes on either side.
On the east side is a rocky cliff face called the Balcones Escarpment.
In the early morning, the Escarpment hides the sun and the whole place is pretty dark.
[[So it was dark when you got there?|intro:dark_when_arrived]] | [[Okay.|intro:rob_goes_to_scene]] 


::intro:dark_when_arrived
Exactly. I really want to revisit it when it's light.
[[intro:rob_goes_to_scene]]

::intro:stuck_hard
You could say that. It would be an understatement, but you could say it.
[[intro:tell_what_happened]]

::intro:why_not_tell_happened
Because if I tell the truth, my superiors will think I've either gone off the deep end, or I'm trying to cover something up.
Neither of those options is viable.
So I go off the deep end and decide to cover it up.
[[intro:cover_up]]

::intro:cover_up
I know that CSS is coming to investigate the scene. I can't have them thinking a gun went off here.
That'll throw off the investigation and I'll have to answer a lot of questions I don't have answers to.
So first I open a window and turn on the overhead fan to get the smell out.
I grab my shell casings off the carpet and shove them in my pocket.
I look at the wall behind where the woman was standing, praying that none of my slugs passed through her body.
If they lodged in the wall, I'm screwed.
But lucky for me, they all disappeared with the green-eyed woman.
Hooray for hollow points.
[[Then what?|intro:wait_for_css]] | [[Hollow points?|intro:hollow_points]]


::intro:hollow_points
Hollow points are the type of ammunition we use.
As the name implies, the tips of them are hollow, so when they hit something, they crumple up.
This makes them do more damage.
It also helps keep them from exiting the intended target and killing someone you didn't mean to shoot.
Cops try really hard to only shoot the people they intend to shoot.
[[Got it.|intro:wait_for_css]] | [[That's thoughtful of you.|intro:cops_thoughtful]]

::intro:wait_for_css
Then CSS shows up and we search the house.
The whole time they're going over the office I'm terrified someone's going to smell gunsmoke, but nobody does.
Once the search is done, I head back to HQ, go into the men's room, and puke my guts out.
I'm there, kneeling on the cold tile floor, listening to the hiss of the toilet, and I realize that I am in <i>serious</i> trouble.
I walk back to Homicide Division, and there's my partner, Dietz.
Dietz says, "Hey, dumbass. Where's my brisket?"
At some point I guess I said I'd bring him back some barbecue from Rudy's.

Well, shooting innocent bystanders creates a <i>ton</i> of paperwork.
That's a cop joke.
Sometimes we seem callous but that's for the benefit of the other cops.

So we avoid showing it by any means necessary.

I have to get out of there, so I walk out of the office and down the stairs and step out onto Eighth Street.

He's your standard Austin hipster, with anachonistic facial hair. He's selling falafel from a food truck. 
He looks so happy.
This guy's worst problems are keeping his mustache even and not overcooking his garbanzos.
In that moment I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone.

I need to get background on this case so I know what I'm dealing with.
Sometimes the best approach is to work from the outside in.
That way you have the information you need when you're questioning the important people.
I can either talk to the Leder's co-workers...
...or I can talk to Mary Jo Irving, the woman who hired him to sell these mysterious crystals.
If I talk to the co-workers first, I can find out if his work might have made him any enemies.
If I talk to Mary Jo Irving first, I can find out more about what the green-eyed woman was after.

Makes sense. Let's get a little background on what's going on.
Here's what I know so far about Mary Jo Irving:
She's a retired newspaper reporter, a real firebrand from back in the 60's and 70's.
She was pals with spitfire Texas Democrats like Molly Ivins and Ann Richards, who was governor when I was a kid.
She retired about fifteen years ago, and hasn't been seen much since.
A few days ago, she hired Jason Leder to sell some priceless artifacts.
And now he's dead.
Sounds like a lead to me.
She lives on Bonniview Street, in Travis Heights. 
It's about a twenty minute drive from here, back down Loop 360 and up MoPac to downtown.
Then I cut down Cesar Chavez, and take the Congress Avenue bridge.
I'll pick you back up then. 
<<delay 38m>>
Did I say twenty minutes? I meant forty.

I just pulled over for a minute. Seeing the Congress Avenue bridge made me think of something.
I remember one time my dad taking us there to see the bats.
There are literally a million bats that live under this bridge.
We're sitting there on the grass outside the Statesman building, on a blanket.
My little sisters are running around the hillside like idiots.
And all of a sudden I look up and I see a cloud of smoke coming out from under the bridge.
I point to it and say, "Why is there smoke coming out from the bridge?"
My big sister shoves my shoulder and says, "That's not smoke, stupid. Those are the bats!"
I look closer and she's right -- what I'd mistaken for smoke is acutally a stream of tiny flying creatures.
There are just so many of them that my brain can't process them as individual creatures.
They just keep coming and coming, thousands upon thousands of them...
...splitting up and dividing into streams that spread out all across the evening sky.
I look at my dad and he looks back at me. And I'm so excited that my dad is paying attention to me.
Because he never did.
And he nods his head, and says in a thoughtful, introspective voice,
"Que chingo de murciã©lagos."
This must be some deep bit of wisdom on my dad's part, I think.
But I barely know any Spanish, so I ask my sister, "What did he say?"
Breathless for some wisdom from Mt. Gilberto.
She looks at me at me and laughs. "He said 'What a buttload of bats.'"
That was one of like nine things total my dad ever said to me.
Anyway, I'll get back to you in a few minutes.

Weird thing, though.
While I was driving here, I noticed something.
I kind of zoned out a little bit on the way, just thinking about everything.
When I was coming across the bridge on Mopac, I was looking at the city and it just looked so beautiful... 
I sort of forgot I needed to get over to exit.
I cut across the freeway at the last second, and I saw this blue sedan whip across right behind me.
Maybe they were also just admiring the view.

Mary Jo's address is at 204 Bonniview, a tree-lined street just south of Lady Bird Lake, and overlooking it. 
I'm getting out of the car and looking past the house I can see sunlight glinting off the waves...
...with kayakers and stand-up paddleboarders skating across the surface.
Up here it's a line of little houses that are -- there's no other word for it -- adorable.
Tiny little post-war cottages, perfectly maintained...
...with just the right combination of delicate care and Austinite shrugging neglect.
The air is filled the scent of magnolia blossoms, rosemary bushes, cedar, and a hint of jalapeño.
A combination of elegant, stoic, spicy, wild.
This is the famed 78704, where they like to say "It's not just a zip code--it's a way of life."
They have half-million dollar houses with plastic flamingoes in the lawn and a guy that sells soup out of a cart...
...and they'll shiv you if you don't recycle properly.
People who don't live in 78704 want to strangle them, mostly.
But we also all kind of envy them for getting to live here. It's everything that's great about Austin, condensed.
But I'm guessing Mary Jo Irving has lived here since before they even had zip codes.

Big red plastic glasses. Big smile. Constant twinkle in her eye. Maybe a little tipsy.
Her place is small but homey. Everything is probably expensive, but none of it ostentatious.

<<d "mary">>Back to Tunguska.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>One morning, Chauncey and the Evenks look up and there's line of blue fire tearing across the sky.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">Knowing Chauncey, he probably took off running for it the second he saw it.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>According to him, when the thing hit, the shockwave was so powerful it knocked the whole tribe right off their feet.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Chauncey would always be quick to add that <i>he</i> hadn't fallen over due to his training and quick wits, which was a very Chauncey thing to add.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>He and the Evenks rode off to find it, but it was so hot, they couldn't get more than 50 miles from it.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>After a few days, it had cooled down, but the Evenks left Chauncey behind. They were terrified of some evil spirits called "Valleymen" and wouldn't go any closer.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>So Chauncey went on his own, picking his way through a forest of flattened and burnt spruce trees.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>After about three days of searching, he came across what he claimed was a a circle a mile wide completely flat, scorched clean.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>And in the center of this circle, he found those crystals.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>He says they were glowing with their own light, and that the air around them waved, like in the heat from a fire...<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>...but they crystals themselves were cold as ice.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>There was no meteor impact. No crater. Just those crystals on the black earth.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Scientists think that a meteor exploded over the ground, but Chauncey had a different idea<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>He believed the meteor crashed <i>in the future</i>, and the crystals traveled backward in time, and that's why there was no crater.<<endd>>

::mary:what_chauncey_do_crystals
<<d "rob">>Ms. Irving, what did Chauncey do with the crystals? Did he just hang on to them?<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Not at first. When he got back to England, he took a small sample to a friend of his from the Royal Society, a geologist.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>This fellow was eager to study the things, but Chauncey liked a drink and the geologist was a teetotaler.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>So Chauncey headed down to the local pub for a pint while the geologist fiddled. As soon as he sat down at the bar, there was a massive explosion.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Chauncy ran back, but by the time he got there, the geologist and his house had been blown to kingdome come.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Nothing remained of the house but scorched, flat earth, and the crystal sample, sitting completely unscathed, right in the middle.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>A few years later, Chauncey came to the States -- booked passage on the Titanic, believe it or not -- and brought the crystals with him.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>He never talked about that crossing, or the wreck. Always said that discussing it would be a disservice to the dead, but I don't buy it.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Chauncey wasn't the kind of guy to let a disservice to anything spoil a good story.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>Anyhow, in the States, he met up with another scientist, a physicist in Chicago.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>He convinced Chauncey to let him have a look at the crystals, and Chauncey reluctantly agreed.<<endd>>
<<d "mary">>One explosion later, Chauncey locked the things away and vowed never to let anyone touch them ever again.<<endd>>

Ugh. Sorry. I shouldn't take my stress out on the firefighters.
I'm just really worried.
I'm learning more about the Leder case, but I'm no closer to finding anything out about the green-eyed woman.

I'm trying not to. But it's all a little much at the moment.
But you're right in that I need to focus on what I'm doing.

I have friends in traffic enforcement. I can make that guy's life miserable.

Wow. This elevator is nicer than my apartment. When it opens, it plays what sounds like an mp3 of an old-fashioned elevator "ding."
As if to ensure to whoever is riding in it that it's only carrying you ironically.
"Ding" again as the door opens. I'm imagining that the "ding" is actually in quotation marks.
